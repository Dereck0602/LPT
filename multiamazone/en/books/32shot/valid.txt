1	The Best World History Atlas Book Anywhere The Oxford Atlas is the best of all competitors. It is full-size, high quality ink and paper, 368 pages and covers most areas of history from the caveman to the present time. I am not speaking of the concise edition but of the full-size edition. The ISBN number is #0195215672. This book covers about 2,000,000 years of history from the origins of humanity to the year 2000. The Atlas is the result of over three years' work by internationally renowned cartographers, an expert editorial team and specialist academic consultants
0	Thank God It's Over! The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother
0	Boring! Sorry, folks, I found The Sunday Wife to be shallow, predictable and just plain boring! None of the characters were appealing and, as I said, I thought it a boring plot
0	Not flash cards The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book.
1	Nietzsche DESTROYS Christian dogma with this book Nietzsche is a genius. His ideas are still as important today as they were the day he wrote them. He destroys Christianity in one fell swoop - anyone who reads the Will to Power and still believes in Christian dogma is in the purest state of denial. Nietzsche provides saying after saying after saying, perfect for debate. If you're a doubter or secular, read this book and you will erase all possibilities of the Bible being real from your mind forever
1	Great Source on Culinary History,Business, and Lore `The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons. So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors. It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows. These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy. By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals. Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as www.foodtv.com, but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com. This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars. Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment.
1	Worth reading What can one say about this book that hasn't been said before? "Speaker for the Dead" is fundamentally different from "Ender's Game." Those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology, which is a welcome change of pace. "Speaker for the Dead" is by turns gripping, moving, frustrating, interesting, preachy and grossly manipulative. It's not perfect, but what is? Wise readers will stop the Ender series at the end of "Speaker for the Dead" and pretend that "Xenocide" doesn't exist. Don't say I didn't warn you
1	Closest thing to Founding Fathers that we have left These days, you don't see many people with the interest or guts to do what Jon Stewart and his co-workers do. In America, the book, they aim to teach misinformed Americans what their government is really about. Many people don't actually know what the heck goes on in the government, nor do they care. The book, filled with hilarious tidbits, great explanations, and well thought out presentations, aims to make the government interesting. It's got history, how the government works, modern day conflicts, theories, ideas, people, and what our Founders did for this great nation. It should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen. Jon Stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this. They went against the grain and did what they knew was right. It's our duty as Americans to criticize the government. When there's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it, you have the responsibility to fix it. Hopefully this has changed America
0	A mid-brow read Waller, why are you writing this stuff? You're an elderly gent, retired I assume, who made a bundle off the sugary-sweet and sappy BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. Take the big money you made and run brother--quit demonstrating your literary nincompoopismo!
0	Disappointment... I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above. The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food. If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few
1	O'Nan rights a wrong.......... Stewart O'Nan has corrected a major oversight by writing so comprehensively about a topic surrounded by myth and folk legend. Apparently, the story of the Hartford circus fire of 1944 has never been told in a book, but Mr O'Nan has dived into the deep end of the myths and legends and surfaced with a factual, well-researched, and eminently readable tale of the tragedy. Covering all aspects of the fire and its' aftermath, Mr O'Nan debunks the stories told as truth but bearing none, reveals new and unsung heroes, and lovingly examines the fate of Little Miss 1565, the lovely, unclaimed child who lay so long in a grave with only a number to mark her presence. This is an exciting read, filled with the thrill of the circus, the horror of a fire out of control, the fate of survivors, and that of victims ....... both those who lived and those who didn't. While Mr O'Nan has moved on to the Boston Red Sox in his book with Stephen King, FAITHFUL, this was his first foray into non-fiction, and he has done himself proud. This is a great story, told well, and with care
0	Wow I can hardly wait for the movie!!! This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time. The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page. Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work. I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick. Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest
1	An excellent classic This book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong, complex characters, and the history of a legendary part of the United States being just two of them. The world through the main character's eyes is a world seen anew. The reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century Brooklyn, the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story.
1	Halley's Bible Handbook This book is a must if you are studying the Bible. Explanations are given of facts, verses, people and places as you go from one Book in your Bible to the next. I found out about it in Bible study class. My Senior Pastor, has a copy he got over 40 yrs ago, and still used. One of the best studying guides you can have in your library
1	and the beat goes on... and the beat goes on... There are several books out there filled with Ginsbergs ponderings (I've looked at most of them)... so why pick this one? For one... this collection spans 48 years of A. Ginsberg's work. Highlighting poetry that the author selected personally. Sure here you will find the ever famous &quot;Howl&quot;, &quot;Sunflower Sutra&quot; and &quot;America&quot; as well as, &quot;Elegy for Neal Cassady&quot; which was written by Ginsberg shortly after hearing of his long time friend's death. However, where many of these sort of books highlight one particular phase the author has gone through (like a gallery showing of only Picasso's blue phase) this tome lets the reader experience the entire Ginsberg. I highly suggest this book for anyone who is interested in getting to know Ginsberg and in experiencing his greatness which spanned over 48 years (longer then his friend Kerouac was on the planet)
1	A Delight The names Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner don't resonate as much as they used to. As the decades go by even the old-timers among us haven't been around long enough to remember them. They've pretty much become historical, iconic figures, like the stoic-looking George Washington on a dollar bill. It's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time, but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive. The author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that Ty Cobb had died. Realizing that many of Cobb's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate, he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record--literally with a tape recorder--their stories for posterity. Twenty six of them are recounted here. Some of these guys are hall-of-famers, some of them not even close, but all of them--every single one--had a load of interesting tidbits to share. Baseball was a different game back then. America was a different place. The first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers. One of the fellows, for example, playing Detroit, talked about being a little nervous about Cobb, whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes. A Detroit player, however, mentioned that Cobb never sharpened his spikes. Not that they didn't discourage the other team from thinking so. Walter Johnson had an arm like a bullwhip, but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of Sam Crawford. Late in the game, if his team was ahead by enough runs, he'd toss a meatball in to Crawford and let him belt it. He never did that for Cobb, though, who he hated. Cobb could never figure out why Crawford was able to hit him. Honus Wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them, with great quickness, great hitting and great fielding. A couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up. Tommy Leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman, shortstop, first-baseman and outfielder in the league--he played all of them--and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you couldn't really argue that he wasn't the best hitter in the league, either. For some odd reason, there aren't that many memorable gems about the great Babe Ruth, although there are at least a few. Harry Hooper (a guy I'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer) remembers Ruth in the first year he came up with Boston as a, "big, overgrown, green pea." "Nineteen years old, poorly educated, only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization, he was gradually transformed into the idol of American youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . If somebody had predicted that back on the Boston Red Sox in 1914, he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum." Along with these detailed sketches, including a ton of characters I haven't even mentioned--Germany Schaeffer, Rube Waddell (who didn't like to wear underwear), Lefty O'Doul, Dazzy Vance--the book is also, naturally, loaded with baseball anecdotes. Some of the more famous plays of the time, for example, are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions. Take the "Bonehead" Merkle play. For those of you who don't know, what happened was this. The Giants were tied with the Cubs for first place with one week to go in the season. In a game against each other, in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game, the Giants had men on first and third with two outs. Merkle was on first. Birdwell hit a single to center, McCormack scored from third, and Merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse. Without touching second. The Cubs retrieved the ball from center field, Evers tagged second, and the run didn't count. Because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date. The Giants lost it, and lost the pennant. From then on and forever more, Fred Merkle became "Bonehead" Merkle. But it's actually a little more complicated than that. For one thing, Merkle was only nineteen. It was the first game he'd ever started for the Giants. And running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did--whether touching second was necessary or not--because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game. The players ran off to get away from them. And Evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands. Fred Snodgrass doesn't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all. The umpires weren't around to know this, though; they had already left the field! Funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things. The detail in this book brings these stories back to life. And there are a ton of them recounted. Along with all of this baseball lore, you get a pretty good glimpse of America a hundred years ago, too. People were more humble, but in general confident, and much more direct. It's fascinating just to consider their nicknames: "Wee Willie" was the nickname for a short guy, "Specs" was the guy who wore glasses, "Chief," (at least two of them) were American Indians, and, "Dummy" was the guy who was deaf and dumb. Nobody meant anything by it; nobody apparently took offense. Stuff like these speaks volumes. Here's Jimmy Austin: " . . . they didn't have clubhouses in most parks, especially not for the visiting team. We'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses. They used to call it a tally-ho in those days. We'd sit on seats along the sides and ride, in uniform, to the ballpark and back. "That ride was always a lot of fun. Kids running alongside as we went past, and rotten tomatoes once in a while. Always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by, you know." Yep. Thanks in part to this book, we know all right.
1	Glorius I love this storyline. Baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be, and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard
1	U2 fans .... a required book !! As a U2 fan since the beginning , this is a book I will cherish . Although the "I" is friend/photographer , Anton Corbijn.... you will feel like it's your own photo album . Taking you via pictures (and Corbijns personal notes) ,through the years of U2 the baby boy , to U2 all grown and on their own ... and in a league of their own . As many times as people have said "a must have" , I truly have to tell U2 fans to buy this book !!! Even if you only love it half as much as I do ;-)
0	What a Crock! This book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout. His theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died. He was as wrong about history as he was about theology. It has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author's earlier publication. This man has been discredited as a theologian long ago
1	Excellent! I absolutely loved this sequel to Something Borrowed. Just as good as the first in my opinion.
0	underwhelmed I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible. However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book. I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler. There are many much better real estate investment books out there. Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet. This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there). The book did not really touch on either of these topics. That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting. These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase
1	Just the text, ma'am This Modern Library edition runs true to form, lacking much in the way of supplemental material or notes but providing a good basic presentation of the text on quality paper in a good binding. An edition to keep on the shelf for occasional reading rather than a student's book. If there's a really good scholarly edition of the "Morte" out there I don't know about it - anyone?
1	If you're struggling with behavior issues, read this book. Exasperation with our son's behavior led to the purchase of this book. He's now 3 1/2. He is high energy in most everything he does. He's more energetic, more intense, more inquisitive, more dramatic. The older he gets, the "more" he has become. This book helped us understand that there are many other kids just like ours, that "more" is not bad (like his PreK teacher had us thinking) and that parenting a spirited child requires a different set of skills. The author doesn't give any one sure-fire way to help with the daily struggles you face with a spirited child, but she does direct you and help you to understand. Without this book, we may have never understood what spirit is in a child
1	Seminal Work This book is one of the only works that addresses the topic of Ecological Design in an in-depth manner. Moreover, it focuses on the progenitors of this movement - the design outlaws that had the courage to forge entirely new and radical paths in art, design, science and technology. Powerful stuff - important message - innovative and engaging subject matter
0	Lacks clarity The author talks about all major developments in the field of Quantum Physics as of the date the book was published, but does not explain them clearly, especially towards the end with topics such as super gravity. The diagrams appear out of sync with the text, and are not explained well. I somewhat liked the book in the begining, but at the end was forcing myself to finish it
0	Better than the first one, but.... This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans. The characters in this story were likable. I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view. I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times. However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable. From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out. I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother. Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc. Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest
0	HORRIBLE!! This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I can sincerely state I will not read another. The way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous. No one - and no one, speaks that way. It made the story feel rushed and stilted, and I am sad to say, much of the humor was lost on me. Something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it. I felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues. I found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly (something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them), and the abuse situations Ms. Coulter touched on, then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting. She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way. If she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed....miserably. Reading this book was an utter loss of time. Don't bother
0	A High School Writing Effort I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read. I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability. The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it. As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting. I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.
0	Dont waste your kids' time! I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students.
1	Laughs galore This is the third Bill Bryson travelogue I have read. This has several laugh-out-loud sections, particularly if you have travelled in the United Kingdom. It is excellent for relaxing on weekends or on a plane. If you have never been to the UK and don't know any British people, then don't form all your opinions based on this one book, but Bryson does a good job distilling some of the differences between our nations into an amusing few hundred pages.
0	Boring I had to read this book for school and i hated it. I thought it was really boring. There was not any action in the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone that I know
0	Let me save you $12.21 today. This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection. I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets! There, you can continue shopping
0	A work for academic readers only This book reads like a PhD dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books, much like a college research paper. I wonder if these 5 star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and I can't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all
1	love it! This book is one of the best gifts I have ever recieved. I just moved into my first apartment, and was feeling really overwhelmed about getting organized and making the most of a VERY small space. This book has so many great organizational ideas that it actually made me excited to get started. It was a huge project, but thanks largely to this book, I feel really great about my new home and I honestly have never felt more organized--such a great feeling!!! Thank you so much for all of the great ideas and tips!!!
0	The Colorado Kid, The King Flops I was terribly disappointed with this King release. Could a creative writing student done better? Perhaps. It was by far the worst published work I've ever read. It was unreadable. Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed. The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere. The book seemed to be published on his name alone. I have been disappointed in S. King for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch. I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.
0	This book ruined my golf game. After reading this book, I caught a duck to use on the links. Despite naming it Ping, my distance and putting went down the toilet. I would not suggest using Ping for your average hacker
0	Not what I expected I think this book should have been entitled Over 60 and Gettin' Stronger. I'm 46 and I was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail. I think it is more geared to people over 60. Quite a few of the models were much older. I won't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go. Quite a lot of the exercises weren't using dumbbells. You get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this isn't the case. I was disappointed with this book. I recommend Weight Training For Dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do. And also, Smart Girls Do Dumbbels by Judith Sherman-Wolin. That book is loaded with dumbbell exercise.
1	So You Wanna Start a Revolution? Common Sense is a must read for all citizens of the USA and world seeking liberation from long established regimes. In this short, but well written published pre-revolutionary work, Paine makes the argument for a complete separation from England. In a time when many were not sure separation was the correct option, Thomas Paine spells out 100 % revolution in clear English that provided the spark for the Declaration of Independence. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and there would be no turning back. A true piece of fine USA history
1	Indispensable for Western gardeners It's about time somebody published an inspiring photo driven book about western gardens. The Sunset Western Garden Book may be the bible for western gardeners for its wealth of information but it does not serve to inspire the way a book full of real gardens can. With more than 500 photos of western gardens this book should be destined to be a classic. The great thing is that it is not just a beautifully designed, coffee table type book. The text is authoritative with dozens of full page charts and it seems to have been reviewed by a who's who of garden experts. The author suggests plants from all over the world that are adapted to a summer-dry, Mediterranean climate and the photographer shows them in gardens not just close-up details. Hooray for this book. We western gardeners are too often frustrated by books and gardening advice originating from other regions. This book is so beautiful it will frustrate gardeners in those other regions who will want what we now have
0	A bit childish.... I am 16 and in love with all Arthurian literature. As I was reading Nancy Springer's "I Am Morgan Le Fay", I got extremely bored. It was so juvenile. Her relationship with Thomas was just odd. It completely destroyed the legend. If you really, and I mean really want to read a great book about Arthurian literature, I can recommend some for you. Obviously, Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece, "The Mists of Avalon" is one of them. Here are some others. **Queen of Camelot ~ Nancy Mckenzie **the Guinevere series ~ Persia Woolley **yet another Guinevere series ~ Sharan Newman **In Camelot's Shadow ~ Sarah Zettel **For Camelot's Honor ~ Sarah Zettel **Prince of Dreams ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Grail Prince ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Sword of the Rightful King ~ Jane Yolen **The Romance of Tristan ~ Beroul **The Firebrand ~ Debra A. Kemp **other works by Marion Zimmer Bradley, such as Priestess of Avalon and The Firebrand
1	Loved It!! However...... I would have liked the hero's character, Diaz, to be developed a little more. He was dark, mysterious, and sexy but even his face wasn't described very well. I couldn't form an image in my mind of what he looked like, like I could with Milla. The story, however, was awesome. I couldn't put it down and my heart ached for Milla. What a read. I would recommend it to anyone!!!
0	Great book for 25 years ago, not current! Please! A great idea 25 years ago, but I think the best in-shape player is Mr. Woods, period. This book was like Jack Lalane meets golf, lot's of enthusiasm but not current training
1	GREAT BOOK!!!!! This books deals great with strangers. It also shows not to judge a person by the outside. The only thing it needs is to tell kids what to do if a stranger does capture them.
1	the most romantic book of love poems ever written perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it
0	Class Warfare Comes to the American Revolution? Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, "to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River." (Nash, xxviii) Nash bemoans how the "great men" still "dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with "historical amnesia," (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the "great men" clique. He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society. These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population. Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories. To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament. He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way. In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City. Led by Ethan Allen, the "Green Mountain Boys," as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property. (Nash, 110 - 114) He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well. (Nash, 73 - 79) In the case of the "Green Mountain Boys," their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon. Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution. In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era. In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state. He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution. (Nash, 271 - 286) In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook. (Nash, 302 - 304) The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies. These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land. This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59) What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise. (Nash, 37 - 39) What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown. (Nash, 157 - 164) Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land. Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves. (Nash, 64) He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland. (Nash, 426 - 427) Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict. First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution. Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective. This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands. If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation. (Nash, 141 - 144) Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities. Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed. In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices. (Nash, 232 - 235) The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations. Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion. (Nash, 151 - 157) What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' "genocidal" policies towards the native population. (Nash, 377 - 381) Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution. That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare. There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters. As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, "The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government." (Wood, 5) Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along "local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences." These complexities made, "any generalization about Americans as a whole," quite difficult. (Wood, 6) Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work. Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the "New Republic Online": Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution. This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it. Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument. Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes. The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare. (Wood, "New Republic Online Review) Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated: But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare? There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes. Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future. In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom. Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves. Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to "expose" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their "elitists" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below. There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people. To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a "tyranny of the masses" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation. However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points. Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers. Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case. It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here. What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell. Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector. To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era. Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed? Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries. This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution. When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to "tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution." (Nash, 367) However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort. Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan. (Nash, 395) If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it? Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large. Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the "Newburgh Conspiracy." It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities. (Nash, 370 - 371) However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy. The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power. Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again. Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era. He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously. However, I would like to offer my own take on this. Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation? I certainly think not. Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself. In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life. Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!" (Douglass, 53) While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind. Nash lamented the "genocidal policies" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution. While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history. Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World. In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable. However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions. Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force. Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution. (Nash, xv) First, I would ask Mr. Nash, "should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?" While historians do deal with the "great men" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below. Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war. We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise. We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country. What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution. Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records. Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences. Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures. Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored. Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side. Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers. The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well. Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution. Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it. Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution. The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals. Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict. Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South. Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion. Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution. The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few "Founding Fathers," but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class. Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in. These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more. These books are not hard to find. Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields. To be sure, there will still be authors who write biographies on the "great men" of the American Revolution, but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict. Thus, Nash is not the lone voice for these "forgotten" as he claimed
1	456 pages of excellent storytelling Taking history and melding it with fiction, and making it highly readable takes talent. Everything is in this book. Furst crosses 11 years (1934 to 1945), has characters move in and out of the narrative as well as have a panoramic/epic show going on at the same time, and never for a moment does the story seem thin--actually it's thick with thoughts, intentions, hopes and dreams of the characters, and their utter and dire knowledge that the whole of Europe is going to go right down the path of total destruction. Also, I must mention the humor. The chuckle is there, right after the sadness or the disaster. Traveling from Bulgaria to Moscow, from Stalinist Russia to a Spain steeped in civil war, Furst offers Bolshevists, the NKVD, defenders of the Republic, partisans, and on and on. There is common crime and the common war, political satire and the poignancy of a common death. Reading Night Soldiers makes you want more.

1	Every Bit as Good as Elegant Universe I would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that "Fabric of the Cosmos" is just a rehash of "Elegant Universe" with little more to offer, and in fact not as well written. On the contrary, I found "Fabric of the Cosmos" to be equally as engaging as "Elegant Universe" and to offer a great deal of new material. It is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books, but I for one preferred it that way. I read "Elegant Universe" several years ago, and although I have a general feel for the concepts, I appreciated the refresher on many of the details. By including the background material in "Fabric of the Cosmos" I never felt lost, and I never had to refer back to another book. The background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books, but it is not identical, so I never felt like I was rereading the same old stuff. Another minor issue I've seen some complain about is the use of The Simpson's (and other) television characters in his examples. Personally I could care less what characters are used in the examples, but from a practical standpoint, I much preferred names like Marge and Lisa to names like Slim and Jim (which were used in "Elegant Universe"). I could easily keep track of what Marge and Lisa were doing in an example, whereas I was often confused about what Slim and Jim were doing. The similar sounding names drove me crazy. So from a practical standpoint, I preferred the names used in "Fabric of the Cosmos". Now what about the content of the two books? For me "Elegant Universe" was more of an introduction to string theory, whereas "Fabric of the Cosmos" was much more an exposition on cosmology. In "Elegant Universe" roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics, and then the remainder of the book, some 250 pages, was about string theory. In "Fabric of the Cosmos" roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics, (about 120 pages) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of "what is space" and "what is time". Then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe. If you want an excellent description of inflation theory, Higgs fields, and the like, this is the source. And then only in the last roughly 120 pages does Greene bring string theory into all of this, and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book. Bottom line is "Fabric of the Cosmos" provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that I did not get from "Elegant Universe". Both books are outstanding, and I would certainly recommend both. The point being simply that these are different books, and "Fabric of the Cosmos" is not just a rehash of "Elegant Universe". Finally, as in "Elegant Universe", Greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next. I've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived. In Greene's book this is never an issue. Sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense, but I would much prefer a book that I can logically work my way through, albeit sometimes with a bit of patience, than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve. Don't get me wrong though, even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense, I never found it to be dry. Greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout. Very highly recommended
1	Good Overview This was a well-written compilation that provides an overview of the lives and departures of certain notorious film entities over many years. The entries I most appreciated dealt with early icons, now barely remembered if at all, whose names inevitably produce the query: "Whatever became of -- ?" Appreciated even more was the author's willingness to reach conclusions about an individual's life and career. He delivered evaluations and even criticisms as warranted. Well worth reading - Al Hooper, Edmonds, WA -- Al Hooper, Edmonds, W

0	Are You Easily Amused? If you're easily amused by anything that hyperactively draws attention to its &quot;cool&quot; sensibility, this book is for you. Stacey Richter obviously went to one too many writer's workshops where they pat each other on the back for their inside-ness and forget what real literature can be. None of her characters reveal any depth or texture. What little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy. Instead, what you get is exaggerated, absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence. Richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references, precious oddity, and patronizing first-person narration. Incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished, then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art. The word that best describes the whole thing is &quot;shallow.&quot; It's as if Richter were writing moment-to-moment, giggling over her cleverness, probably sipping an Orbitz because it's &quot;so stupid, it's sublime.&quot; After smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job (I'm looking down at my watch), perhaps Richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for Blind Date

1	Great book! I suggest this book to anyone who wants to, or are thinking of, delving into C - no matter how deep! What I love about this book is that it's good for a non-motivated person like me as well, because the exercises at the end of each chapter really make me wanting to finish them up (sort of like how teacher used to make us do it in high school.) If you think you already know the material of a chapter, then just skip to the exercises and try to see if you can do those - if you can, then just continue on. If you can't, then simply check over the chapter again to re-test your knowledge
1	On Time - Item as Represented I was very satisfied with this purchase. Book was brand new as represented and was shipped in a most epedient manner
0	Got bored quickly My roommate gave me this book and I thought it would be a good read during the winter break (I am a college student). Halfway through chapter 2 (pg 18) I decided to stop reading the book. The book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic. This book explains why is that. But it doesn't teach you how to become more logical

(no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no. when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad. in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)
0	Save your money I thought this book would provide more insight on kitchen appliances and ways to downsize but cook different meals. The recipes were awful in my opinion and I would not want to eat them even at home, much less on the open road. A few good hints but not at the price of buying the book brand new
0	Only for first year, if u are doing indepth o-chem then this isnt it Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components. The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry. One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry. All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox. The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry. The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it
0	Inconsistent - some greatness amongst some disjointed tedium I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night. As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization. One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid. The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called "The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse. The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable. Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather. One of the "1 star" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of "who cares" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less. Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre. I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style. There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable. Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story. Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy! The paperback story is 1130 pages of small type that is hard to read
0	Unbelievable I have read every one of Stephen King's books. This was the only one that I have not read. I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one. The style of Peter Straub stinks. Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about. Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.
