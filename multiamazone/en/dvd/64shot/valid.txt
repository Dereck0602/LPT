0	The Death Of Jaws Who wrote this movie? That is the first thing I had to ask myself after watching this movie a couple of months ago. Oddly enough, this movie was one of my favorite "scary" films to watch as a little boy...but, as an adult, WOW...this is just BAD. The original Jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second, although not as deep or well paced, is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline. This movie, on the other hand, is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover...at sea world! Who would ever think to incorporate SEA WORLD into the Jaws franchise??? Seriously, It was just a horrible idea! The whole, "Mother Shark lost her baby shark" scenario is just weird...I don't even think that Shark's raise there "pups" once they are born...they just swim away. Not that this is that much different than the plot in Jaws 2, where a "relative" shark of the first Jaws decides to go after Cheif Brody and his kids...cheesy, but still, more fun and overall a better storyline. This movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-D graphics add a overly grainy, aged look to the film. The acting is horrendous. Dennis Quaid is OK, but everyone else is just plain awful. Also, who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass? Who OK'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark's nose hitting it 3 times??? That's not too safe in my opinion. This is just a bad, bad movie. There isn't much that I can say is GOOD about it...but, I will give it 2 stars because it entertained me when i was a little boy and for that i am thankful
1	A real treat of a movie, and an important one, as well. The Firemen's Ball is one of a handful of Czech films that defined the &quot;New Wave&quot; era, and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world. Other important films of this period include Forman's &quot;Loves of a Blonde,&quot; Jiri Menzel's &quot;Closely Watched Trains,&quot; and &quot;Larks on a String&quot; (a Menzel film that hasn't been released on DVD, to my knowledge). But Firemen's Ball is a personal favorite, probably due to the fact that I lived in the Czech Republic for five years, and attended similar village balls. The characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor, affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed. In the end, Forman does what he does best -- he leaves you torn between laughter and tears. This film is a must-see, especially for those who are interested in understanding how filmmaking evolved in the 60s
0	Film: 4 stars, DVD: 1 I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay! Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD. I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too. Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio. VIDEO: C- AUDIO: A FILM: B
1	The Best Comedy... EVER! This movie has been my #1 Comedy for many years... still is... and most likely will continue to be for many years to come. It speaks to anyone "raised" in a cubicle - you will find in almost all the characters "someone" you knew at some point in your life, when you worked at "so and so". So many real-life scenarios I felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days! And every time I've watched it (and yes... that number is in the "double" digits) I always find something that I overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again, as if for the first time! A true gem! Feeling blue? Just pop this movie... you'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours..
0	Emerald33 If I had seen this in the movies, I would have walked out and asked for a refund. It was indescribably terrible. I returned this DVD because I really, really didn't like what I saw
0	Worst This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love the first one but this one is just lame
0	So disappointed, so very disappointed I laughed like a loon when I watched these shows as a kid. My sides hurt and tears came to my eyes. For years, I told people that that this was the best, most creative, funniest show ever aired. I tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but I never did. Suddenly, I found this collection on Amazon and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch. I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed. Nary a laugh or even a snicker on the DVD. Truly disappoined after decades of waiting. Sigh!
0	Good visuals, very confusing story I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused. The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through
0	An ironic anachronism, replete with Hollywood PC shibboleths You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of "Islam is a religion of peace," repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism. A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up. After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the "President wants to appear presidential." Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a "fascist U.S. Army general", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all). Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them! But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for "violating the Constitution" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the "fascist" general. Ta-dah! So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists. Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool. I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book
0	Kevin Coughlan is spot on! I'd write a review for this sewage, but Kevin did it so perfectly that I'd be wasting my time. The only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was Silent Hill, and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game. And now, there's a Spyhunter movie coming out? WTF is next? Prince of Persia (...please don't do that one, I was only kidding!)? Get the video games for the real thing
1	A great classic! You will want to buy this movie once you have see Madea's Family Reunion
1	Found in Translation This Noam Chomsky speech on DVD is, as usual, enlightening. Mr Chomsky documents the facts, the truths, and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years. This speech and the bonus interview with the Harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively "believe" what we are told by our government, rather than seeking to "know" the facts (or simply ask, "wait, is that statement true?"). Mr Chomsky explains patiently, that facts are important. Words and meaning cannot be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners.
1	Awww... This movie is incredible. It has a great way of deminstating how judgemental people that shouldn't be judgemental are. This movie catches your heart and you get wrapped up in it. 5 STARS for sure. Its was an incredible movi
1	A timeless masterpiece on universal themes Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be? Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning "To live"). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to "live it up" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor. Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, "The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same." Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy. The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its "inner life." Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado. Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is "The Mummy." Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed. It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces. Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or "Mr. K," as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar. The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews. Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them. There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to. It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa. Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered "too Western" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this "Mr. K" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you "hate" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term "timeless classic.
1	"He found himself yearning to know of their affairs", Directed by Saul Dibbs, this opulent adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty - his decadent coming of age novel about love, class, sex and money set in the hypocritical Thatcherite Eighties - is indeed a feast for the eye. Beautifully acted, with a spot-on affinity for detailing time and place, The Line of Beauty replicates Hollinghurst's hedonistic themes and the moral quandaries of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens), the titular middle-class outsider in this world of privilege. As with the book, this film adaptation begins in 1983 when the young twenty-year-old Nick Guest is asked by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to come and stay with his family in their sumptuous Notting Hill home in the Kensington Park Gardens estate. Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a sycophantic Tory Member of Parliament who is on the rise, and is basking in the glory of Thatcher's economic policies. Gerald lives with loyal wife Rachel (Alice Krigg), his daughter Catherine (Hayle Atwell), and Toby. Nick's comes from a provincial, terribly middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - but he is welcomed into the Fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time, he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic and troubled Catherine. Nick is wined and dined, enthusiastically partaking of the family's lavish parties and political dinners, trying to impress them in their superficial discussions on literature, art and antiques. Nick tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom, but he's unsure of his footing in this opulent, prosperous looking-glass world. In fact, Dan Stevens plays Nick with a kind of wide-eyed, eloquent fury, always nicely mannered, but forever hidden is the ever-present pretension and affectation, and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror, this troubled man finds it reluctant to give its approval. Nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure, yet when he falls in love with Leo, (Don Gilet) a lusty black cockney and socialist council worker, he finds himself caught in a Jamesian-like dilemma, wedged between the powerful, privileged life led by the Feddens and their friends, whilst also having to face the stark realities of Eighties Britain - the vast unemployment and the rise of AIDS. The second and third episodes of the series feature Nick's relationship with Wani (Alex Wyndham), a long-lashed Lebanese millionaire playboy. While working as a creative consultant on Wani's new magazine, Ogee - named after the curve that is Hogarth's line of beauty - Nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes, moneyed decadence, and cocaine-fueled days and nights. And of course this all culminates in the beautifully recreated coke-fuelled dance with "The Lady" herself, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (Kika Markham). This BBC adaptation follows Hollinghurst's book pretty much to the letter, although in some instances, the film fails to catch much of the subtleness and nuance of the source material. The scenes involving Nick's sex and coke binges in the toilets and bedrooms of his grand surroundings seem hurriedly cut short, and the pivotal scene of the dreary piano recital fails to capture the tiniest social shenanigans and inherent boredom of all the guests as well as it could. Also, when the Fedden's take Nick on their holiday to France, the pacing slows a bit, but thankfully picks up speed again in readiness for the final dï¿½nouement, the penultimate dance with The Lady. The cast is solid throughout, but Stevens is without a doubt the standout, imbuing Nick with a neediness and an obvious desire to be loved. He speaks his emotions and is in need of reassurance of his place within the Fedden household. He exists in a limbo space of not quite belonging, and in innocence of the dark undertones of the world he has entered. Amidst the euphoria of first love, champagne and high society parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, deception, and the ultimate hypocrisy towards his sexuality, and that of his bretheren. The unsaid mantra is that it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you keep it quiet and do it in private. The Line of Beauty is indeed a richly textured coming-of-age story, and accomplished adaptation of a classic work of literature set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade of change and transformation. Mike Leonard October 06.
0	Sorry, Spy Hard is a waste of time I love Leslie Nielsen, but this movie is not funny. His better movies are Wrongfully Accused and the Naked Gun movies
0	"R"-Rated movie, NOT PG-13!!! Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've read the other reviews and I don't know what version they got but the DVD I received has more than a brief scene of David with his wife (breasts CLEARLY exposed)in bed. That scene alone would not be allowed in a PG-13 movie. There is another scene where David is viewing Bathsheba bathing. She is standing, completely nude and you can see everything. Then the camera pans in close for a "waist up" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body. This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut
0	This Stunk Bad plot, bad acting, bad filming. The surprise ending was a surprise because I had nearly terminated this boring, stupid film long before. The actress playing the little girl was especially poor
1	Prevention Fitness Systems Express Workout - Belly Butt & Thighs I love this workout CD. It is simple & I get a really good workout from it. I like that they have three 10 minute segments & you can do them all or one. The butt segment is my favorite section
0	Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so
0	Living proof as to why and how Hollywood often insults the intelligence of today's movie-watchers. This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it. Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's "pet" squirrel escape his pants to the "bathroom" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call "toilet-bowl humor." Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call "amiable," "heart-warming," or even "cute"; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe "artist" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a "special edition" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing
1	"It's the world against us and us against the world!" Oh so dashing Errol Flynn is Peter Blood, a doctor thrown into slavery without just cause. Fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates! Arrrrrrrgh! Highly entertaining from beginning to end, normally when a film gets boring I bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here! This film didn't let up for a minute. Even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, who by the way is smoking hot in this movie. Another reason to get this DVD or even better yet the Flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called "Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born". Did you know co-star Ross Alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with?! Yikes. Also check out the score by Erich Korngold
0	I want 48 minutes of my life back This could quite possibly have been the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire existence! First off...Jim Carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public.(animals included) This movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store...it shouldn't be there. The only laughs I had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie. Sure you may come back and say it was a student film...but honestly, where the hell could he or she be a student at!! Who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity. Sure the girl was Fat...nbut that wasn't here main problem. The acted like an idiot all the time and then ALLOWED people to call her BIG J!! This is a complex written all over it. This is BIG J calling was always followed by some cheap Yogi Bear impresion...once again retaining back to the fact that she's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear. Jim Carey didn't even entered this movie untill about 20 or so minutes into it. And just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film. I was not impressed and don't recommend this waste o time, film, and brain cells to anyone thing. Even if no one is watching this movie in your house, Please don't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the TV screen. MY CAT DIED, WHILE VIEWING THIS FILM. please heed my warning
0	Full Version or nothing I saw the full version in the USA in the theater under the title Queimada within the last year, and it was fantastic. That's the version I want, and Region 1 customers should at least have that option.
0	Preview it before you show it. I bought this for my SciFi class. We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film. It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach. Everyone was so disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up. The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff. Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long. Bela Lugosi is a much better bet. For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans
1	Silence on every playground This is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that doesn't disappoint. It's a bleak and distubing look at the world, two decades from now. Chaos has erupted everywhere as people are overcome by an overwhelming hopelessness. This fear is generated due to the fact that no child has been born for eighteen years. It's a countdown to extinction. Theo(Clive Owen) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country. To the casual viewer this may not seem like much of a task, unless you can really submerse yourself in the context of the volatile situation. I totally got caught up in the effort, completely absorbed by the significance of this mission. The action really kept me on edge. I was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes, you know--hell, fire and brimstone. Any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points. This is touched on periodically, but doesn't go too over the top. I also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read "Last one to die, please turn out the lights". There's always gotta be a prankster. Overall, I thought this was a great movie--action-packed, original, and insightful
0	Dated and dull Uncut magazine from England rated this 5 stars and DVD of the month. They also claimed the Coen Brothers paid tribute to it Big Lebowski. This was enough to make me shell out the bucks and buy it. Imagine my dissapointment. The picture and sound quality were dire. Too much contrast in the video and the sound had to be turned up super loud to follow the dialogue. The movie came across as just another viet vet/counter culture exploitation movie with a trite plot that hardly went anywhere and never engaged me or made me feel any suspense. Dialogue was dated and cliched. I'll never trust an Uncut Reviewer again. Don't waste your money on this one
1	A beautiful, sweet story, both for children and adults I first was attracted by the music and I them got the DVD from the Public Library. After viewing it a number of times, I just had to have my own copy. The Irish legend of the silkies is presented with assuming warmth and understanding. It truely is pure magic
0	The Rock and Vaughn stole the show Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie. Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it. As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad. How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me. She is not attractive nor can she act. She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit. I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better. His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak. And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so. The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn. Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie. I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping. While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again. Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.
1	Very Namaste I loved Yoga Shakti very much. There were 2 DVDs and a booklet inside the case and the first DVD contained all 4 yoga workouts like Basic Flow, Solar Flow 1, Solar Flow 2 and Lunar Flow. Shiva Rea performs all of these vinyasa flow practices alone on the gorgeous beaches of Maldives'Island and Kerala, India.The extra archival footage included of Indian festivals and practices in temples is also a nice surprise.This DVD is definitely worth every penny.
0	emotionally and dramatically flat and lifeless; set decoration is the only lively thing on display Roland Joffe directed two masterpieces: The Killing Fields & The Mission. But those two films, directed in 1984 & 1986, were made twenty or more years ago. I'd recommend either of those two films to anybody but Vatel I would recommend only to those viewers who can enjoy a film for its look, its set design and its attention to period detail even when the story and characters themselves are not all that captivating. Vatel is a film that should have everything going for it. As mentioned the director has at least two masterpieces to his credit, Tom Stoppard had a hand in the screenplay (more on that in a minute), Uma Thurman is beautiful, and Gerard Depardieu & Julian Sands & Tim Roth are each capable of delivering memorable performances when they feel inspired. The problem is no one feels inspired by this material. And that is in part due to a lackluster set of characters--supposedly based on actual people--and a story that never really manages to capture our imagination. Gerard Depardieu as master steward "Vatel" is required by his boss, the gout-stricken Prince Conde aka General Conde, to arrange elaborate feasts and entertainments for a visiting retinue of royals that include King Louis XIV, his mistresses, his brother, and various advisors & handlers. If these feasts and entertainments succeed in capturing the kings fancy then Vatel's boss may receive the honor of commanding the French troops in a war with Holland (that may or may not happen). So virtually every frame of the film is dedicated to following Vatel as he personally oversees virtually every dish and set decoration before it is presented to the royal retinue. As viewers we are amazed by Vatel's ingenuity with everything from outdoor theatrical sets that resemble large fold-out books to his ability to make delicate lanterns out of vegetable gourds (Martha Stewart would be impressed) but our interest is purely aesthetic because we never really care whether the Prince gets his royal comission or not and we barely care about Vatel. Next to the selfish, scheming and utterly corrupt royals the selfless and earthy and incorruptible Vatel seems, well, selfless and earthy and incorruptible. Along with his many domestic and artistic talents Vatel also has an uncanny way of understanding people's true natures and needs better than they. The problem with Vatel is that he is perhaps too selfless and so while he busies himself with entertaining others his own life is virtually a non-event. Uma Thurman plays a woman of precarious social standing. She is from a noble family but her position at court is not yet secure and like everyone else she must humor the King to assure his continued favor. When he suggests that they meet in private "for a cup of chocolate" she has no choice but to agree. She is under no illusion that she is anything but a temporary amusement for the King but to refuse the King's advances would be social suicide. The royal world sickens her and we are supposed to see her as somehow too earthy and real for court life but one problem is that this character is barely there. Uma just barely goes through the motions when she is onscreen; instead of seeming like she is dissatisfied with court life she just looks like she is dissatisfied with having to be in this royal dud of a picture. This is too bad because she is supposed to be the muse that awakens or re-awakens Vatel's long dormant passions but there is absolutely zero spark between Uma Thurman and Gerard Depardieu. When the obese fifty-something Depardieu kisses the thirty-something Uma we just don't get it. Few screen romances have ever felt so unconvincing and so void of passion and so uncomfortable to watch. We do know that Depardieu as Vatel is capable of feeling affection because he is very fond of his pet parrots but alas none of this affection is apparent when Uma Thurman is in frame. We're supposed to feel that its the rabid social competition of court life that reduces love to a mere game of conquest and that true love in such a world doesn't have a chance. Instead what we feel is that lack of chemistry between actors is what kills passion. Since the Depardieu-Thurman romance doesn't manage to throw off even one spark the primary story-line is D.O.A. . The elaborate theatrical productions and fireworks displays might hold your attention for a few minutes but this film is not interesting enough to hold your attention for two hours. Julian Sands does a pretty good job as King Louis XIV and Tim Roth an ok job as one of the kings advisors but neither of these actors are given anything very interesting to do or say. Though Tom Stoppard's name appears in the credits when you look closer you realize that Tom Stoppard didn't write an original screenplay rather he merely adapted a French text. Thus even though this film tries to ride on the coat tails of the Stoppard penned Shakespeare in Love this production does not have any of Stoppard's signature cleverness or wit.
1	The Little Mermaid: Classic Disney This movie is just as good as I remembered. It's a classic Disney fairy tale, full of love, longing, fear, action, and beautiful songs. And the scene with Sebastian and the chef is priceless! If you haven't seen it yet, you can't miss this film
0	DO NOT buy this movie~ worst ever! This is seriously the worst movie ever. The last time I saw it was in the theater, and I still can't get over how bad it was. In fact, it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy.... We didn't speak for six months after we saw it together! I too wish I could give it no stars.... And obviously people aren't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002! I can't believe you can even buy it on DVD
1	FABULOUS!!! Is there a better Hollywood musical? I don't think so! Julie Andrews is phenomenal!
1	Kurosawa's modern crime drama Crackerjack suspense yarn by Kurosawa based on the novel KING'S RANSOM by Ed McBain. Toshiro Mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product (shoes) for a bigger profit; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe. But then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded, only it turns out to be NOT his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time, his chauffeur's son. He's faced with a moral dilemma: should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially, or not? He decides to pay and get the boy back; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper. At this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural. The kidnapper's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer. Mifune is ruined at the end, but public support is behind him. It's a great crime drama; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit. What I found most fascinating was how differently the Japanese police handled the case from the way American police might - so much more compassionately. Definitely worth a watch
0	One of worst movies ever made It is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one. Personally I can not blame him. Throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes, (note I am the most un pc person in world so if I am put off it says somthing) and an apperance by larry king, and and you have everything wrong with american movie making. Please note- Jon Lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turke
0	An Incoherent Let Down After an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe, I had such high hopes for season 4. Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point. The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: "Alright! I get it - You're evil!" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found. Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah. Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds ("Dude, you just saved a puppy!"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley.
0	WHAT??????? This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good. But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes. The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary. Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came. The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers
0	Average Movie I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review. This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript. To compare it to "Run Lola Run" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend "Cube".
0	Hellhounds on my Trail: Lost Scent &quot;Hellhounds on my Trail&quot; is a disappointment. The legendary Robert Johnson, perhaps the greatest blues musician in the history of this country, is unseen and effectively unheard in this collage of generally mediocre performances by admirers and wannabes. In fact, the two weakest performances in the film are the opening and closing sequences. The only insight which comes through clearly here is the vast gulf in talent between Robert Johnson and his imitators
1	Unique (one of a kind) Film Here's yet another film I saw as a young lad. But this isn't just any western comedy...It's got that special something that only comes around ever now and then. Terance Hill does a great job as Trinity. For instance in the opening scene Trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans, which he puts away quite quick...I read on his website that he starved himself for 24 hours in order to do that scene. This is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy. I would also recommend Trinity's third film "My Name Is Nobody" which stars Henry Fonda. Anyway...if you like good western fun then I would say buy this dvd and enjoy
1	As good as the BBC production Comparable in quality to the BBC production in six parts starring Colin Firth as Darcey and that was not easy to achieve. Moreover the additional treats such as Joe Wright's comments on his work are highly interesting
1	Brother, Can You Spare a Dime is a Great movie My name is Amanda and I'm in a 10th grade world history class. We are currently studying the Great Depression and WWII and we have just finished watching Brother, Can You Spare a Dime. This movie helped me to understand not only the culture and life of this era but also helped me to understand the things that led up to the Depression and Stock market crash as well as Pearl Harbor and WWII. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants an entertaining way to learn a bit about history
1	Much needed and appreciated... While this might not be for everyone, it is something to behold. I happened upon the 'O' show, as she spoke about it (wayback when) and I was very intrigued. Before that episode ended, my order was being placed for the DVD version, here. I purchased the CD version, after watching the movie. It was beyond words (I found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie) and I'm incorporating the Secret in my life as well as my family. I listen to the CD version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work, at night. It has helped me immensely and I'll continue to do so. I'm so very glad that I decided to check here for the hardcover book...hooray, the price has been reduced...yipeee! I'll get that as soon as I'm done with this review. Thanks Rhonda Byrne and aloha from Hawaii
0	Just plain horrible I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good. This was not one of them. Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley). The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look". If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity
1	A fun movie There are far too few movies that are made just for fun these days. Down Periscope is proof that you don't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie. My teenagers loved it, setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers. Kelsey Grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role, playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie. Known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub (an old rusty diesel boat) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern Navy. Fortunately Grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone. The crew consists of stereotypes, from the flatulant cook, to the grizzled old veteran, to the spoiled son of an admiral, to the basketball star, to the spit-and-polish XO, but the actors manage to bring them off with charm, especially the electrician who Grammer notes has "absorbed a lot of voltage". In addition to the big laughs, there are the little scenes that bring a smile, such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to "see if the other rooms are still tilted" Ultimately it is a feel-good movie. It doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts, but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch! Of special note, San Franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the "mothball fleet" in Suisun Bay and the docked sub shots of the "Stingray" are the USS Pampanito, a sub open for tours at Pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end.
0	total utter nonsense!!!!!! this is pure drivel!!!!!clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film;like the director wasnt given enough money to make it,so he thought,you know what,im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film,that'll show them.the &quot;plot&quot;,if i can re-tell it without vomiting,is thus:a plane is struck by lightning,and kills all the pilots..............i kind of lost what was going on after that......the ending,if there actually was one,was that whatever predicament they were in,they got out of.where can i begin?????clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics,as they'd have pointed out that this ISNT POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!im a little bit rusty on my physics,but isnt it called a faraday coil???if not then forgive me,my minds a little indestinct,but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane. &quot;what about the glass,it passed through the glass window!!!&quot; you bark smugly,well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people,you ever been hit by lightning indoors??have you ever heard of this happening in real life before??NO,BECAUSE IT CANT!!!!!! well done,you're learning.anyway,enough of the banter,the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop,the cable(??!!) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense,some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish,a hint of romance between a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;female human being&quot;,and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says &quot;i skipped bail&quot;,&quot;are you a criminal?&quot; she asks!!!!!! well of course he is you stupid fool,he just told you!!!! any time there was &quot;turbulence&quot; the camera was wobbled about a bit,and the &quot;actors&quot; moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments,where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car,that was brilliant!!!!he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead...then later he gave the oxygen mask,great!!!!! all the scenes involving the radar room,they were something else!!!!the ending also,the rubbish CGI aeroplane,what a laugh!!!!i could go on and on and on,pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film,but i think ive said enough.in short,dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash,then this is definately for you!!!! i laughed nearly all the way through it,so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5
0	Not too good even with beautiful Sandra I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a "good show". The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself. There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief
0	Complete Waste . . . . . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back. the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened. Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive. not quirky or interesting. they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that. and did i mention it was boring? so mind numbingly boring. there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting. i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this
0	eastwood great as always, everything else.....eh Being a big Eastwood fan, I bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night. Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles. Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always. This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous. After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband? I mean, no one says a word to him. And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing? Are you kidding? I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break. This ain't no academy-award winner. Eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey
1	One of the Top 10 Horror Movies Ever Deffenitly one of the best movies ever made in horror. The plot was deep and it itroduced the world into the best horror icon there is. Unlike others (Freddy) Pinhead had not changed his attitude. Loads of gore and people getting ripped apart. They even have a few sex scenesthrown in their. Clive Barker really knew what he was doing when he mad this movie. Go out and get this no or you will be sorry you didn't cuz this is a classic.
1	pretty good Fantasey! To tell you the truth i had never read the book before because the libary always has other holds on it but i went ahead and wacthed this movie with my sister and younger brother we were hoping we would enjoy it despit bad reveiws, so it turns out we liked it, my sister said it's seem's more of a remake of lord of the rings (as everyone else does ) the dragon was wonerfully done we liked the fact that it had a mind of it's own. Ed Spellers did better than i thought for a newcomer, i always enjoy Jeremy irons (exepct for the really bad D&D)the only miscast really was John Malvoich as the evil king i just think he didn't fit well, overall a pretty good fantasy not a classic but good enough for me.( it's my 3rd favariet dragon movie besides dragonheart and dragonslayer i highly recommend those)
1	The last picture show review A fine picture about life in a small Texas town. Easily a classic if they would give the added footage back to the directo
0	Don't buy this compilation...... These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu. However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this ) Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way
0	0 STARS: These movies are worse than the original. These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies. From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive". The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too! What a worthless...waste
1	This film knocked my socks off! Cronenberg a little more restrained than usual -- except in the jolting scenes of violence, and in the question of how and if we can change who we are. Fantastic performances all around. I was very impressed
1	My dog Loved it! I am not kidding! My dog just sat right in front of the tv and watched this movie from beginning to end! He really loved this movie a lot and likes to watch it when ever we do. Anyway I really like this movie! The actors are great! I liked this movie more cuz the star is from jurassic park back in 1993. And I liked the intire cat and dog spy stuff. This movie was great and I think you and maybe your dog will like it too

0	uwe boll fails at life Have you ever been stabbed in the face? I haven't but while I was watching this movie, I had this almost overbearing curiosity to find out what its like. Seriously, this movie is so bad, suicide won't erase the haunting visions of sheer ineptetude from your mind. this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. well, there are worse movies out there, shatter dead and 13 seconds being two that i can name off the top of my head, but i mean come on both movies had a combined budget of a McChicken sandwhich with a small order of fries. whats this movies excuse
0	EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD.

0	since when did wesley and woody become lovers? take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie
1	Awesome movie about an awesome man: I loved it because it really did show Sagan the way he really was. He did a lot of really wonderful things and I will always miss him
0	It's a snore I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on
1	EXCELLENT! Very uplifting, 5 star performances, Top Music Neil Diamond is BRILLIANT in this performance, and moreso with the musical score. Excellent, excellent show, you'll want to watch again and agai
1	Highly Recommended Eye Candy This DVD showcases some of the best visual artist talent in the VJ and nightlife industry today all mixed to some killer trance music. All of the visuals are stunning except I am not a big fan of the contributions made by Bionic Dots. They seem to be overly paranoid about showcasing their work so they obnoxiously brand their content with annoying info bars across the bottom of the screen. The video content is great as is for playing at parties or can be utilized as source material by any interested VJ in mnay creative ways. This DVD is well worth a purchase for anyone that has been mesmerized by video screens at a top nightclub or underground party - highly recommended eye candy
1	A 4-star movie with a 5-star ending This was a great little movie. It wasn't a stand out in the genre, but it had all the elements it should have had; a great lead cast, clever and funny writing, and most importantly, a good story. Where it lacked, and lacked badly, is in the supporting cast. Chris Kattan and Parker Posey were the weak links in both acting and story line, and in my opinion cost the movie a 5th star. The story around Adam and Steve was very well done and I enjoyed the casting. [Who knew Malcolm Gets had that body??]. It was a delightful movie night for my hubby and I. We're both suckers for a sappy, happy ending, and this movie delivered.
0	WHAT! $58 for a B-movie slasher flick!? You people are on some serious drugs
0	I really wish I did not see this movie. After I saw the first two "Scary Movies" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes. I could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache! I myself, a teen, which this movie appealed too did not find this funny. I don't know why teens like this movie so much. -Ben Russell
1	I Liked It Very Much I rarely watch American TV anymore because of the chance to see crime drama at it's best like the "Touching Evil" series. I have epals that I share my favs with and visa-versa. The "Touching Evil" series was recommended by an epal because of it's intelligent drama. I rented it, for the lowest price, of course, just in case it wasn't worth the cash. I really liked it. I do have my favorite episodes, though. The first episode, "The Lost Boys" of the series and the first episode in Series 3. Series 2 and 3 do not have specific episode titles, so I call this one, "Hearts". "The Lost Boys" introduces Detective Inspector Dave Creegan(Robson Green) to us. Creegan is volitile, yet brilliant. He had been wounded in the line of duty, which was followed by psychiatric counselling. It makes one wonder why ACC Enwright(Michael Feast) called him back into service. Creegan's emotional volitility caused the breakup of his marriage. After getting to know Creegan as a character, the audience can see why. Creegan is a "driven" man and has instincts that can see through the mask of a criminal as he does in "The Lost Boys". Creegan sees through the mask of university professor Ronald Hinks(Ian McDiarmid-Sen. Palatine from Star Wars). Creegan fights with Enwright and other team members to get Hinks arrested for kidnapping 3 boys, but Hink's lawyers have a larger case for Creegan's harrassment of Hinks. Creegan is teamed up with DI Susan Taylor(Nicola Walker), Detective Sargent Jonathan Kreitman(Adam Kotz) and Detective Constable Mark Rivers(Shaun Dingwall). There is conflict almost immediately between the team members. I would like to see a 4th "Touching Evil" series, if only to clean up some questions before ending this intelligent series. My biggest question, of course, is "Why did Enwright bring Creegan back in the first place?" Creegan made it clear that he was a "one-to-one" person and that selling ice cream would probably be the best job he would enjoy AND he was psychologically unstable. There is also the question of why Taylor was picked to partner with Creegan. "Hearts" is just plain brilliant. All the actors are at their best in this one, but Robson Green stands out. After the murder of a friend, he finally crosses that psychological line. Green is brilliant followed by Andy Serkis(Dr. Michael Lawler). The other actors follow closely behind. Do I recommend this series. YES, but only the British one. When we Americans try to recreate a wonderful program like this, we always fall short
0	Clarification of previous review Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD transfer, I was only referring to the &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; DVD. The Father Goose DVD is not that bad
1	"Who Do You Say That I Am" 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' had the very real potential of being one of the biggest disasters in motion picture history. Think about it for a moment. Who would want to sit through a 3 hour and 19 minute film about Jesus with a virtually unknown blond haired, blue eyed Swedish actor named Max von Sydow in the lead role? Add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in Hollywood. Sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project. Surely director George Stevens pulled off a major miracle. Aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary Alfred Newman, some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you'll ever see and an unforgetable performance by Max von Sydow 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' lived up to it's title to become the definitive film version on the life of Jesus of Nazareth. A classic from '64 that belongs in everyones' DVD library. One of the Essentials
1	Good '80s action cartoon We have here 12 episodes of the classic TNMT series based on the comic books by Peter Eastman and Kevin Lair.More characters are introduced:Letherhead the Florida swamp alligator,Usagi Yojimbo a rabbit samurai from another dimension,Lotus the female ninja and Metalhead a turtle robot created by Krang.There are more than 190 eps.If Lionsgate continue releasing volumes with 12 eps each 15 or more will be necesary to include all the seasons.Will be better release full season sets with 30 or 40 eps each one.Hope they can hear this
0	Awful If you want to find out about Evel Knievel avoid this garbage. I don't own it but I saw most of it on tv and was appalled. George Eads was not too bad a choice but they could have found someone better. And what's with the peeing scenes? What kind of a statement were they trying to make???? I never did see the ending of it...it was that lousy. It's a complete disaster. Someone needs to do a big motion picture about Evel Knievel like they did about Muhammed Ali. The best actor I can think of is Matthew McConaughey as Evel.
0	disappointed We do not think this video is worth purchasing. After receiving it and viewing it we were disappointed in its storyline and also the quality of the tape itself. I didn't think I would find a Tom Selleck movie I wouldn't want to watch but this is the one
0	Not for UK Use Do not buy this product for use in the UK, the HD part will not work from a location outside of the USA, it requires internet access to authenticate your license to view, if this is outside the US then it will not work. If you have a Multi region player the standard DVD will work fine, it is only the Computer Media that require WMV-HD auth.
0	terrible I thought it was boring.I didnt like the concept of it was too jewish. I didnt like they made jews too strict. I didnt like the way they made the customs. I didnt like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions. For example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath. I could understand it because i am an orthdox jew. because i have gone to yeshiva. Most non jewish pepole cant understand the movie. As well as non orthdox jews.Boaz yakin had no right makin the movie like this. he should make a sequel to learn from his mistakes to make it a public movie. I wish i were in show business to make the movie more normal
0	Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ing! When I saw that M. Night Shyamalan was directing this film my interest was peaked, despite the silly premise about an apartment superintendant rescuing some otherworldly nymph from the complex's pool and trying to return her E.T. - reminiscent character home. I enjoyed Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" (despite both films' easily predictable endings) but was very disappointed with this downright soggy outing (sorry, have to throw some water puns in here). I laughed outright during the first 15 minutes, promptly dubbed it "The Watery Tart" [/monty python]; then fell asleep out of sheer boredom soon after, thereby missing the bulk of the film. I'd highly recommend it to anyone having trouble sleeping.
1	Excellent DVD transfer. I was comparing this season with similar DVD's that were in the same years, even much later, and I must say these DVD transfers are top notch. Hard to believe this show is 40 years old. The color and sound came out great. No one should be complaining about the quality of the transfers, A
1	Deciever is Far Too Overlooked and Unnoticed I cannot believe the scarcity of people who have actually seen this movie. Tim Roth is an incredible actor, and his intelligence permeates into a very believable role in a modern mystery/noir with staggering twists and turns of a mental battle between the interrogates and the interrogated. The story pivots the balance of power like no other movie I've ever seen. It is an exceptinoal psychological thriller that leaves you completely satisfied. I had no complaints with the acting or music (You won't enjoy the ending as much if you don't like oldies music, however), and the story is top notch with a script that plays it out thoroughly. The cinematography is above average, and very in sync with the music to make a great finale, and a great movie
1	Talk About Values! Somew movies just have 'values' and the original The Four Feathers is one of them. FEATHERS is set in England and the Sudan about ten years after the Mahdi killed General Gordon. In fact, seeing Charlton Heston in Khartoum would be a good lead-in to 4 FEATHERS.The plot revolves around four friends, all young officers in the same regiment and all heirs to an aristocratic military tradition heavy on the memory of the Crimean War (see the original "Charge of the Light Brigade" film). Three men boldly go to the Sudan with General Kitchener's expedition. One chickens out and resigns his commission, losing the woman he loves in the process. To redeem himself, he goes to the Sudan on his own and must help his former comrades. The story is well-explained, well-paced and has great values of timing, editing, and direction. The technicolor and the score are both excellent. 4 FEATHERS is a cut above other British productions of the period in terms of technical quality! FEATHERS also exemplifies the best values of the Victorian UK upper class-- belief in country, honor, loyalty, heroism, and sacrifice. The remake is a pathetic immitation of this original, which did not need a remake, now or ever! A must-see and a great addition to any DVD collection
0	disappointed I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them. However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed. The camera man can't seem to sit still. When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do. By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow. Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise. It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment
1	dvd -Love Comes Softly "Oh my goodness!!!" If you LOVE a feel good, emotional roll-a-coaster, family movie. This is it!! This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It has all the elements of every emotion you can come up with. The actors are superb and you feel like your part of the scene. I have watched it 3 times and will watch it again. Just make sure you have a box of kleenex handy
0	Not my cup of tea I rented this movie because I like Luke Wilson and I was in the mood for a romantic comedy, but I was very disappointed. There's just about no chemistry between Wilson and Kate Hudson, and she was just terrible. Throughout the entire movie, I could practically see the acting wheels turning in her head--her portrayal as a somewhat prudish, somewhat mousy character was both unnatural and incredibly annoying. If not for her bad acting, I would have given this movie a higher rating, because it did have its funny and some sweet moments (if you can ignore the implausible plot). There just wasn't enough "good" to compete with Hudson's "bad.
1	I liked it........... Kris and her father get into a car accident and she ends up loosing her father. Kris and her friends go to Belgium to clean out her fathers study where he had been working on his latest manuscript. While there the caretakes talks them into taking a tour of the mine. While in the mine the group learns the story of Andries Martines who was a murderer and also into black magic. However as it turns out Andries spirit was not laid to rest. I don't want to give away too much of it but I really enjoyed it. Very well done all around and creepy which is a big plus considering some the stinkers I have seen lately
0	Please don't waste your money.... Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..
1	Hard to resist due to good performances... I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force.
1	A nice film by Lasse Hallström This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. "My Life as a Dog" known in Sweden as "Mitt Liv Som Hund" is inarguably Hallström's best known foreign language film. Though he has done other films they are American or British made. "Chocolat," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and "Something to Talk About." He is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous Swedish pop group, ABBA. The film is about a 12 year old boy in 1950's Sweden. He is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill, his antics prevent her from recovering, so he is sent to live with his uncle. He meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople. He often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is. The film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas Sweden and some fine photography also. It remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards. It won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the AMPAS. Though it is described by many people as a family film, it got a PG-13 rating in the US. Mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue. There is a half second of full frontal female nudity, though non-sexual, it still may be a cause for parental concern. The other scene involves material that I feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it. The special features on the Criterion DVD include Lasse Hallström's first film, "Ska vi gå hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt?" which translates to, "Shall We Go to My Place or Your Place or Each Go Home Alone?" This film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children. There is also a theatrical trailer and an interview with Lasse Hallström. The liner notes also include a special notation about the film by Kurt Vonnegut. Fans of Swedish cinema will enjoy this release
1	Real doc or commissioned vanity piece? Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production with an "A+" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a "debut" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding "Dream Of The Blue Turtles" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some "oh so precious" moments-especially a sequence depicting a "goofy" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in "La Dolce Vita"? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite "Spinal Tap" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her "lack of imagination" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a "Brechtian effect". (You couldn't write something that funny.) The tardy yet belated release of the film on DVD should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics,sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period
1	Amazing My child is 1y & 6m, I found [Baby Babble] is perfect for him, as the movie start, he start watching and trying to repeat after, but sometimes he won't be in a mood to watch, so I have to think about the perfect time for him each day which I found that it vary from day to day
0	Don't buy into the "product description." First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying "Jaws" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by "Jaws 4- The Revenge," in being worse. "III was originally released at the theater in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more "made for TV," as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, "Yeah, right!", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning "Officer and a Gentleman" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of "Jaws.
1	"You are go for the moon." I agree with the space nerds yelling "Sananaigans!" over the footage from different missions being put in here to look like it was all from Apollo VIII. It kind of makes you feel ripped off. Example: The space walk footage was actually from the Apollo 9 mission!...or so i've read. Also as a person who knows very little about the space program I was disappointed in the lack of fact giving narration. The footage is breathtaking and I learned a lot, but I wanted more information and I wish they had put up a disclaimer telling when there were images not from the Apollo VIII mission. Worth watching preferably on a large high definition television.
1	When Night is Falling This is a powerful down to earth movie, It is very well done. The actors, script , storyline,,,is totally awesome. It is a must sse for,,not just the alternative lifestyle communities. Jenn
1	As great a tour as the two albums it was promoting. The 90's Quadrilogy of Achtung Baby,Zooropa,The Passengers(released under that psuedonym)and Pop are the last daring albums of U2's career. This concert footage parodies not only U2's celebrity, but celebrity in general. With banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage, the band was mocking it's own ubiquity. Sadly, they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour
1	if you like hard hitting stuff... What is it with the British film scene and its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the likes of Ray Winstone in it? Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one, but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces. I personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass, dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate. But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him. We learn that no matter what environment children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow. Without wishing to give too much away, it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things
1	I am reviewing the shows not the format! This is a wonderful collection! It is misleading and disappointing to see the rating for this set so low--especially when many ratings were based on "wide screen" as opposed to "full." The format doesn't change the story or the fun viewers have watching. "Gidget Goes to Rome", however, is my least favorite. James Darren had chemistry with Sandra Dee and Deborah Walley; it was lacking with Cindy Carol. Enjoy the innocence of an era gone and relish the fact that we are fortunate these movies are still around --- in wide or full screen
1	A heartwarming movie I really enjoyed this movie because it was funny as well as sad in parts. Leonardo Dicaprio is by far the best actor I have ever seen
1	Great price for both versions! I personally don't watch the hours of bonus stuff. I know lots of people do but I never do. I love this set because we can watch the long versions or the short depending on if we just need a fix or want to spend the entire weekend watching the set. We got a great deal on this set and I love knowing I can watch either version any time.
0	the name says it all this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours. and for chrissake - he's NOT an american
0	Bad, just plain bad. Spoilers ahead: I am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies, and totally enjoy a good B flick. But I have to say that this one was just terrible. There's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever, I just couldn't believe how stupid the main character really was!! How do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you? I mean come on!!! Breaking into the rangers office on site, no less, and getting drunk...all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her? Then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho. Was no one else shouting at the screen "Grab the cop's gun and shoot the psycho!" as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike. And running infront of the truck, in the headlights... There was forest all around her and she never once went and hid, just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom. A sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it's misery in my opinion. No, it was simply unbelievable and I was relieved when the credits rolled. So glad I didn't actually pay the rental fee on this one
0	Appalling Excess I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife. Here are my gut impressions: First, very little is true to the book. That's not really a gut impression. That's the impression I got hearing my wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..." Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling. It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie. I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching. You get to see... A kid chasing a ticket through a train, A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train, A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train, (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!) OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have... A train sliding out of control on the ice, A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice, A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole. Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have... A train car running out of control through Santa's village, Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then... Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf. Ho ho ho. At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out! It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion. You know it's awful but you can't look away! And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this. It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up. My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't. So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume. Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit. Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the opposite. Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little. I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.
0	Thompson the terrible Why do I dislike Emma Thompson so much as an actress? Aha, I know why -- she can't act. She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal
1	Catastronic This musical is riviting. It lets your imagination run wild. It is something for young and old to enjoy. A must see
1	Great dialog exchange! The story is only so-so but the exchanges between John Wayne and Kathryn Hepburn are wonderful and make the movie worth seeing. This had the potential to be really good
1	A simple and cute kids movie My four year old loved this movie. The plot was very simple and easy to follow, nothing too complicated for her. The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children
0	Pretty bad cheese The first 5 minutes was OK. After that, this TV-movie started using all the cliches of...a TV-movie. A bad one. These cliches include: 1. Many references to babies both on and off the plane. 2. Young love as apparently-orphaned young adults ponder their future together. 3. A supposedly very drunk man becoming rowdy and argumentative, yet showing no real signs of being drunk though much was said about the volume of his drinking. 4. An unhappy man dictating some thoughts - then eventually joyfully reconsidering his comments and throwing the tape recorder away. 5. The expanded time frame, where events that would normally take perhaps a couple minutes dragged out for 1/2 hour - in this case the final descent of the plane. 6. Simplistic explanations of some "technical jargon" for the benefit of only the audience. 7. Voice-overs of the thoughts of some of the characters as they are about to land. There were also some bad lapses of reality. These include: 1. The claim that the airplane had never been test-flown or simulated when out of gas. 2. Having some sports cars whiz by only feet away - on a wet surface no less - from recreational hot-rodders parked on the abandoned runway who are working on cars and milling about. 3. The apparently stupid teen who can't hear his father yelling and waving at him from 30 feet away to get the hell off the runway as the plane is about to land on him. The worst for last... 4. No one even attempts any crash position during the landing. 5. After landing, the pilot and co-pilot sit there for 10 seconds and contemplate the minor amount of smoke coming up through the console. Note there is no actual fire whatsoever... 6. After all the passengers slide down the rear slide, the co-pilot and other crew slide down, and gather right at the bottom of the slide rather than, say, getting off the runway away from the plane. Only the pilot remains on board. He lingers in the doorway, then decides to go back into the nose again. Why? To fight the nonexistent fire. Egads! He is now overcome by smoke. We wait and wait for him to reappear, but gosh, he doesn't. So the crew must climb back up the ladder to rescue him. Finally everyone gets off the plane. Everyone cheers and congratulates the foolhardy pilot. The End. Except it's not. There is a freeze-frame on each of the characters with a caption telling what happens to them in the future. I wanted to give it at least 2 stars but in all honesty I can't.
1	"Turn the Sun Down": Teen summer fun cartoon with Daria. I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it! "Is It Fall Yet?" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: "The Tom Thing" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it. Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating. Tom and Jane have broken up. This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane. The two bonus episodes on the dvd ("Fire" and "Dye! Dye, My Darling!") show how "The Tom Thing" happened. It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie. Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp. Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated). The other `Daria' characters have their own situations. Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale. Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool. They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that. Watch the movie, and see for yourselves! Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams. (How I remember my high school days! I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!) Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's "King of the Hill" series. Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot! Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'. Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream. His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work. The pair doesn't have time to date. I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the "Beach Blanket" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria. The song "Turn the Sun Down", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the "Daria" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect. Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series. A somber Daria is at the movies. Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. "Turn the Sun Down" is played in the background. At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast. There are a few gross outtakes also included. "Is It Fall Yet?" got me interested in the "Daria" t.v. series. To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head". I purchased her "Daria Diaries" and "Daria Databases" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters. I'm presently reading her `Diaries'. And I, too, hope that the complete "Daria" series gets released on dvd in the very near future. But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with "Is It Fall Yet?" And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes. A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria "Do you ever smile??" The answer is Yes! And this movie is sure to make you smile. It's a gem in the "Daria" series!
0	Disappointed with new voices We just purchased this item and when we got home and loaded it up, was very disappointed in the new voice they're using for Bob, Lofty and Spud! The video itself is great and they've introduced a new off-road 4x4 machine. But honestly, it just doesn't seem like a Bob the Builder without the main voices we're all used to
0	Sleeping Pill! Not a workout! This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other. I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace. Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner. I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it. I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better
1	this is the it ! buy this right now ! This is a great dvd,alot of xtra feature.I think of all make up effex this is the best + love the soundtrack !!

1	DENZEL NEED I SAY MORE---GOOD LIKE EVERYMOVIE HE ACTS IN--GOOD STORY LINE WITH A TWIST..
1	Interesting Collection This is an interesting, odd little collection for Karloff fans. I don't think you'll be disappointed although the "Boogie Man..." is a little odd
1	A competitor to the stage show version....... Recently my husband, daughter and I went to NYC to see the Broadway version of the POTO. The show was outstanding and a pleasure to see on stage, but I have read many reviews that criticize this newest film adaptation. I strongly disagree! This special addition DVD delighted my entire family. I am very impressed with this movie version and highly reccommend it. Its depiction of the POTO story is evocatively romantic and the music is a "perfect" score. The special additions reveal just what lengths Andrew Lloyd Webber, director Joel Schumacher and their collaborators went through to finally achieve this production. It also contains the evolution of the POTO stage show as well as the movie. Gerard Butler is the ultimate Phantom and I was enchanted with his singing. If you love captivating music and romantic movies - buy this DVD
1	BIBLE SERIES BOX SET VERY SATISFIED. USUALLY BIBLE MOVIES ARE VERY POOR IN ACTING,ETC. THESE WERE VERY WELL PRODUCED AND HAD SOME FAMILIAR ACTORS. THE MOVIES SEEMED TO STAY WITH THE BIBLE
1	Great Documentary I want my children to remember what happened on that horrible day; this dvd will greatly help. The events of September 11th are well documented from beginning to end. I especially liked the fact that CNN did not try to politicize anything-- they just told the story based on the facts. Well worth the price
1	A classic tale of adventure, true love, and REVENGE! When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne... What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it... If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story). Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece "Dance of Curse" for instance. It reminds one a lot of "Duel of the Fates", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode "mystic eyes". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears. Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.
1	Excellent Anime! This is one of my favorite anime series of all time. I've had this collection for about a month and not only have I watched it repeatedly, but I've shown it to all of my friends and now they all want it! This thinpack boxset is a great value over buying the series individually. One note: This has all 12 episodes of Fumoffu on 3 discs, while the separate DVDs have 12 episodes on 4 discs. (When I saw a fourth disc for sale I got worried that I was missing something.) I watched all of the Fumuffo eopisodes before watching the complete original Full Metal Panic and still thoroughly ejoyed them. There isn't much carry-over between them, although the characters are the same. I love Sosuke's deadpan comic lines. My favorite episode is the "Patient of Darkness," where Kaname tries to get a rise out Sosuke in a haunted hospital. A must have for your anime collection
0	didn't like it this movie was way too fictional. stephen king needs to stop writing
0	One of the most overrated films of all time. The best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and Scorsese's knowledge of New York personalities. But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets. From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy. Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking. I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing "it's funny" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny

0	Pure Garbage. One of the worst movies ever You want to learn about Evel Knievel but you don't with this film. Awful.
0	Stan and John Create Surface Tension This dvd first caught my eye with high expectations and a low price. The price turned out to be too much. Stan Lee and John Buscema are two of the greatest comic book creators that have ever lived, but this dvd just isn't good enough to meet their standards. It offers much in the way of comic book jargon, but displays each business element very poorly. The main focus of this "visual" video is verbal instruction. There is a very limited amount of important hands-on drawing, barely even enough to teach a learning artist anything. I think that HOW TO DRAW COMICS THE MARVEL WAY could have been done a lot better and should offer a great deal more. Unless you are an avid comic book fan, I do not recommend purchasing this dvd. And, even if you are, I would give it some serious thought
0	This Movie was very Disappointing This movie is strickly for the women now I see why it was made for the lifetime channel. It was hard for me(as a man) to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters. I was looking for a happy ending and didn't get it.
0	Bad Quality of DVD Very disappointed with the DVD quality, it is even worse than any new VHS tapes. Even at the first time I played it, some part was not able to play. I wish the DVD/CD purchasing policy covered the case how to handle defect DVD/CD. Contents do cover a lot bellet movements
1	If you do not know this movie by heart, I'm gonna tear your eyeballs out and suck your skull! Ten stars. That simple. Between a flawless performance by Douglas and the advisory/cameo role of Jeff Beck, this movie backfired on Stone. Its brilliance is as much in its apparent insight into "80s greed" as it is inspiration for everyone who firmly believes that one Ferrari is simply not enough. Virtually every line of this Oscar-winning masterpiece should be committed to memory, not for it purported value as a parable re: capitalism gone bad but as an arrow in one's quiver for daily conversation. "I create nothing; I own.
1	Definitive Trilogy of Streisand's Three Romantic Wallows This collection of three epochal films from Barbra Streisand's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker. All succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers. The earliest is 1973's "The Way We Were", which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances. Veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents wrote a strong, multi-dimensional character for her in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling. In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, "The Way We Were: A Look Back". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures. The second film is 1991's "The Prince of Tides". In only her second directorial effort (after "Yentl"), Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis. She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well. The movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. It is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. The movie is not without flaws. First, after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie's climax, the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein and a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Regardless, it's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together. The last movie is the weakest of the trio, 1996's "The Mirror Has Two Faces", still her last starring vehicle. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably. At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale. As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in "The Prince of Tides". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves. At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in "The Owl and the Pussycat") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. This is a worthy collection for any Streisand fan
0	Great film, lousy DVD I'm really tired of the shoddy DVD manufacturing used by many studios and distributors. This is a great film. I have it on tape. I was thrilled to see it'd been released on DVD. I love Italian knock-offs of American films (STREET LAW seems inspired by DEATH WISH), and I'm a Barbara Bach fan. So I bought this STREET LAW DVD brand new, as soon as Amazon offered it, without waiting for the price to go down. I unwrap the pristine-looking DVDm pop it into the player, and after a few minutes it pauses. Then it pauses again. It pauses constantly throughout the film. I mean at least once a minute, often several times a minute. Pause, pause, pause. Most of the pauses are brief, some last several seconds. I eventually took out the DVD, cleaned it, but it didn't help. I suffered through 50 minutes of this film, then gave up. VHS was a decent format. Tape had problems, but nowhere near as bad as DVD, with all the skipping and scratching. (And Google "DVD rot" -- see what comes up.) Still, changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we'd already bought, so I guess it makes sense for them. I don't know whether I got a bad copy of STREET LAW, or if this DVD is part of a bad batch, or how widespread the problem is. But beware
0	Not what I was hoping for I like to laugh. This really didn't do the job. I was hoping for something monty python style. It has its moments. I've seen the one guy in the Sierra Mist commercials and they are funnier. I've read where these guys have done some shorts and they are better. I would like to find them if possible.
0	Not worth it Boring! All this time is spent during the DVD talking about the John Fisher technique, but not really showing you anything specific. Lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted, all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique'. Who cares! I didn't order the video so that I could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique, I ordered it so that I could train my own dog. So little instructional information was given and the video was so boring, me and my dogs fell asleep watching it. What a waste
