1	A question for fellow reviewers... Okay, I haven't actually purchased the fifth season of "All In the Family", but what I need to know before I do is how many episodes does it contain? Is it the standard 24? This info would really help. Thanks
1	The product of a bygone era in movie-making... In "Lassie Come Home," "National Velvet," and "The Courage of Lassie," Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ... Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five Academy Awards... As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity... Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young Liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men... Anticipating her later images of young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both saintly and mature... Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.' Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle... From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, "National Velvet" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making... Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance... The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream... Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern...
0	A Curiosity This DVD is a good way to see what Houdini looked like. That's it for the positive side of this review. The story is ridiculous, Houdini does no magic and only one escape. That escape is so poorly photographed, however, that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the "wet sheet" tie that was used in insane asylums at the time. This film flopped at the theatres, and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece, ignoring the magic and escapes that made Houdini famous
1	I've got issues with this DVD, but hey.... I'm giving this DVD four stars because the sound is good; it's excellent. I'll overlook the fact there are times he's singing, but the microphone ain't quite there. It's obvious Marilyn Manson puts on one hell of a show. This DVD is rockin', in that sense. Just remember, teeenie boppers, it's theatrics. Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and others, in the late sixties and seventies, did this sh--. Manson ain't nothin' new. It ain't like Satananic theatrics are scary anymore. This DVD borders on a three star rating. It's just that he does put on one hell of a show. Marilyn just isn't all that and a bag of chips. His theatrics are good, but it's hard to take a man, in a thong like S&M type outfit, seriously. Oh, when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous. I'm sorry. Smellin' his butt with his fingers just gets comical. I still give it the four stars because I like his music, and this DVD sounds good. The editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song. Sure it's well done, but it ticks me off when bands do this. Bad Religion did it; but, my lord, how much money does this band have and they release this kind of DVD? It annoys me. I probably should give this DVD three stars, but it does rock. You just have to get over the fact Marilyn looks like an idiot. He lacks that toughness to pull off the look, if that's possible. If he walked into a bar lookin' like he did with the thong leather pantie crap, a woman would kick his butt...You can reference a Guns 'n' Roses review of mine, I believe even Axyl Rose, in his cute little shorts, could kick Marilyn's butt... I know that wasn't politically correct, but it's true... Screw it, I should give it three stars, but the show is flippin' fun..
0	Music from The Strokes? No. Interviews? No. Good DVD? No. It's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning. But skip this one. You should be sleeping. I am a die-hard Strokes fan so when New York Stories came out, I had to have it. Much to my disappointment, it turned out to contain no music by The Strokes, or interviews with any members of the band. If you still feel like you need to see this DVD, don't pay more than $5 for it. You have been officially warned
0	But The Movie Only Has One Even though I am not a Streisand fan, I was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was. The plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible - to the main male character. The problem is, she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover! Somebody (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are disgusting. BAAAAAAMP! (That's the fallacy alarm going off: men, in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.) There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference! Yet truly, the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand, discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, "Wazz I a pretty baby? WAZZ I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?" In that one scene, Streisand's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed. The whole movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast, crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s emotional issues like that. I really think that the "Funny Girl" phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes. The media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think Ingrid Bergman.....). I recall reading about how her glowing complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy and voice) carried her through despite her looks: long nose, large lips, slanted eyes. Myself, I think she looks like an Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like Grace Kelly..... So why can't she accept this? The majority of us women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do! This movie is not about that. This movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable. Maybe I should've given it only one star
1	10 Stars! I can't say enough good things about this movie. I watch a lot of anime, but I have to say this is the most well animated movie I've seen. You completely forget you're watching a cartoon. The characters just come to life. All of their subtle movements make them seem like real people. Especially Hana the transvestite. She was animated with so much attention to detail. It's so incredible! And then there's the story. Three homeless people find an abandoned baby and go out searching for the mother. These characters show so much heart and you really find yourself caring for them. And each of their situations for why they're homeless are all so real. So then they find the mother and then there's a huge twist in the story which I wont give away. I'll just say the ending is a miracle. Fantastic movie

1	Silent Running This is a little cheesey but, the movie is a classic. It's a rather touching movie if you focus on the plot
0	Bad Quality of DVD Very disappointed with the DVD quality, it is even worse than any new VHS tapes. Even at the first time I played it, some part was not able to play. I wish the DVD/CD purchasing policy covered the case how to handle defect DVD/CD. Contents do cover a lot bellet movements
1	"Always Be Closing!" Glengarry Glen Ross is a superb drama directed by James Foley (At Close Range), and starring a powerful all-male cast including Al Pacino (Heat), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator), and Jonathon Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl). The movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by David Mamet, who also helms the screenplay to the movie version. The thing that drew me most to Glengarry Glen Ross was the dialogue. And since I tried my hand at door-to-door sales, I felt very connected to the characters in the movie, especially Sheldon Levene, played remarkably by Lemmon. The presentation made by Alec Baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist. The movie is not just for salesmen (even though I find it mandatory for anybody who's considering a career in sales), but for everybody who appreciates real movies. Recommended
0	[No 0 star rating] An Unbelievably Stupid Film Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.) For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white! Stupidity not worthy of further commentary
0	BUYER BEWARE I ordered this on November 2, and even though Amazon have been listing this as being 'in stock' for a week or so, my order still hasn't even shipped yet. I have asked Amazon to provide a reason for this, but they haven't done so... I think it's terribly misleading of Amazon to list something as being 'in stock' when orders placed two months ago haven't been filled yet. Buyer beware...
1	I LOVED IT!!!!! I bought this recently, when i was about to watch it I thought it was going to be the stupidest thing i have ever seen. But after the first few minutes i loved it. The special effects were good (for 1914) The only thing i didnt like is the WEIRD music and the naration. Whats wrong with panio or organ music
1	Definitive Trilogy of Streisand's Three Romantic Wallows This collection of three epochal films from Barbra Streisand's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker. All succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers. The earliest is 1973's "The Way We Were", which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances. Veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents wrote a strong, multi-dimensional character for her in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling. In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, "The Way We Were: A Look Back". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures. The second film is 1991's "The Prince of Tides". In only her second directorial effort (after "Yentl"), Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis. She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well. The movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. It is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. The movie is not without flaws. First, after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie's climax, the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein and a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Regardless, it's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together. The last movie is the weakest of the trio, 1996's "The Mirror Has Two Faces", still her last starring vehicle. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably. At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale. As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in "The Prince of Tides". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves. At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in "The Owl and the Pussycat") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. This is a worthy collection for any Streisand fan
0	beware noting to do with Jet li or once upon a time in China Cant even belive it's not good. Amator night at the movies
0	A Little Nasuating I had avoided this for sometime but finally relented so I could see a young Diane Lane. She is the only redeeming part of this rather silly movie, not even product placment clips of Paul Newman and Robert Redford make it bearable. Hideous accents abound and way to many sexual references i.e. statues in the Louvre, porno flick to make it really innocent. Olivier is really pretty awful, he must have been really hard up for money to support Joan Plowright and the kids. Broderick Crawford playing himself is even worse. Where did they come up with this cast? So rent Henry V or Rebecca for Olivier; All the Kings Men for Crawford; Long Hot Summer for Newman; The Great Gatsby or Butch Cassidy for Redford and just say no to A Little Romance.
0	A Poor Excuse For A DVD Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising! Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it "digital transfer" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording. I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man. The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing.
0	What? Being a Texas Chainsaw fan I of course picked this one up. It has 2 big stars in it, and was directed by one of the writers of the original. I'm not sure what they were going for in this one. Is it a horror, a sick comedy? It is all over the place. What is worse is that they made Leatherface a wimpy crossdresser. The ending leaves you scratching your head. Mathew and Renee do their best with the material
0	i thought anthony minghella was incapable of making a worse movie than "the english patient" ... oops, mine bad!
0	One Star For Violence--Five Stars For Heroism I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys, "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved! We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc. I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys. So, that's what I have against this film. As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence. And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that! And, I enjoyed the photography also. So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film? Email:boland7214@aol
1	Heartwarming and good for an evening in......... For anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they "gave away".....for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way...have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better...or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when "feeling" was what life was all about, this movie should be right up your alley. It is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times.......and still like it
0	Truly Disappointing After I read Erik Larson's wonderful book "The Devil in the White City" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes' story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of "Mondo Carne." With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn't it
0	The worst Pixar movie ever I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you
1	Very good flick I was shocked as I looked at this movie plenty of times and passed it up, until I read an article in Fangoria #244 article on Stuart Gordon, and decied to rent it. I would say the asking price is to high$15 is more reasonable. This movie does not get boring. The action is good, the plot is good, the acting is actually very good. this movie has already been broken down so no need for me to do so. Overall if you are looking for a good movie that will keep you awake and interested check out "King of the Ants", it is a good flick and doubt you will be dissapointed I know I was'nt
1	My little Thomas fan loves this DVD! My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them. They are his favorite and I don't think that will change for a very long time. Thomas provides great life lessons like sharing, caring, and friendship. They get a thumbs up from me as well!
1	Pre Pre Pre Pre Great inspirational movie. I was very surprised that my 16 YO son also liked it. Really good movie for anyone with children that participate in sports. A pleasure for adults too as it is an excellent story about how with focus, discipline and perserverance, you CAN reach your goals
1	Lyricalintizimist Review Anyone with love for Tupac Amaru Shakurs' work can appreciate this movie.To those pac fans.Don't forget the soundtrack
1	Bizarre Entertainment The greatest crime you can commit whilst watching a David Lynch film is to NOT watch it in one-sitting; a reason as to why Mr. Lynch did not condone the insertion of chapter breaks in the original 'Mulholland Drive' DVD&#8212;it happens to be the incentive for the viewer to sit through the whole film in unremitting concentration, a sort of meditation. It would also explain his infatuation with 'Transcendental Meditation', which he claims to have been practicing for a number of years, and his desire to instill that peace into his cult following. So, if by any chance you want to unravel this smorgasbord of haunting sexuality, bloody violence, and the mystical bizarreness which is 'Lost Highway' then it is wise to stray away from the conviction of a linear plot. It is much more lucrative to compare the chief theme of each his films rather than trying to put together the scattered images of one film&#8212;let&#8217;s say, as an example, the 'Mystery Man' (Played by Robert Blake in this particular film) and the 'Cowboy' from 'Mulholland Drive'; you can draw the correspondence at once by comparing their facial elements: mainly the shaved eyebrows. Therewith, one can surmise what Lynch tried to personify by those two characters&#8230;a singularly obscure despot&#8212;evil&#8212;like the devil, and also the gateway into the supernatural. Indeed, in a recent interview, director Lynch confessed that Lost Highway and Twin Peaks take place in the same world&#8212;which is more than enough evidence for us to navigate all his films since 1977&#8217;s 'Eraserhead' and search for cohesion on the whole rather than through one individual film. All this aside, 'Lost Highway' is certainly a worthy experience; it is singularly intriguing, interspersed with bizarre sexual liaisons and a chilling soundtrack&#8212;a mix of hard-edged techno-industrial, slightly spooky jazz, and orchestral compositions from Angelo Badalamenti. Patricia Arquette & Bill Pullman pull off memorable performances as the husband and wife whose marriage is on the rocks, Balthazar Getty is thoroughly convincing as the 'reincarnation' of Fred Madison (Bill Pullman&#8217;s character in the story) and Robert Loggia playing the sinister mob boss with insidious perversions. 'Lost Highway' may at times frustrate you with its non-linear narrative or it just might not be on-par with your taste, yet you don&#8217;t have to be genius to figure out that during our brief span of consciousness David Lynch certainly knows how to screw our nerves.
1	GREAT SUMMARY OF CORPORATE CRIME Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms. More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations. As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike.
1	A highly original Western comedy... A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy... When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails). Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford. As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant. But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge... Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try... The DVD Repor
