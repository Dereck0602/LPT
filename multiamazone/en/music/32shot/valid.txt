1	Richness in vocal style and upbeat melody... Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to keep you moving!!
1	fluid musicainship, great catchy tunes, a gem of a disc Jeff Golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say Bob James or the &quot;Crusaders&quot; They move from funky tunes, thru soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious uptempo grooves. This is really enjoyable instrumental work, familar but never hackneyed. The musicianship is exemplary, tight and inspired throughout. I'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly reccomended
0	Pass Me The CTA Please... I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds. The caller gets on and says, "Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc. I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is...
0	i hate this This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all. Jason Mitchel
1	This IS baby making music. Well, I am amazed that at 64 or 65 years old Ron Isley is still making incredible music. However, some of the lyrics are explicit. This CD would be great for a honeymoon. The CD should have a sticker on it entitled, "SERIOUSLY, FOR ADULTS WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN!" But I guess that's why the CD is entitled, "Baby Making Music.
1	Even in his 50s, he's still THE rock-musician Say what you want about Bruce "getting old", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame. All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as "The River." For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, "Don't Look Back." And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of "Born in the U.S.A.", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string. For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of "BITUSA" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing. ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the "staples" (i.e. "The Promised Land") might be dissapointed. And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term "to each his own" is definetely applicable. Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985? No. Is it worth it nonetheless? Yes
1	Greatest album ever made. Keane is one of the greatest bands of all time. The fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song, with no guitars at all, shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that's out there. There are more than enough guitar-based bands. "Somewhere Only We Know" is the best song of all time. Beautiful lyrics, solid piano backbone, and a steady, moderate tempo, make it a brilliant album-opener. The album has upbeat pop/rock, like "Bend and Break" and "This is the Last Time," slow, sorrowful ballads, like "She Has No Time" and "We Might as Well be Strangers," gentle, peaceful melodies, like "Sunshine," and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like "Untitled 1" and "Bedshaped." Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers.
0	CARS SUCK, ACDC SUCK, BOSTON SUCK, AND STEVE MILLER SUCK THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK
1	Best soul in ages. This album blew me away from the moment I heard it. The only downside is there are not many songs with vocals on the album. If you like old funk or soul then this album is for you. These guys will leave footprints in the history books of this genre
1	Small ensemble swing at its finest (bill_faust@fitch.com) Its doubtful that there have been two jazz musicians more suited to record together than Ben Webster and Sweets Edison. Alumni of the Ellington and Basie bands respectively, these two mainstream swing players have marvelous chemistry on this session. The charts are perfect vehicles for Webster's warm tone and silky phrasing as well as Edison's blues-ridden melodic style that matured in the mid and late 1950's. Most of the tunes swing hard anchored by a solid Basie-esque rhythm section. You'll wear this one out
0	There's so much better stuff out there I saw Barrage last night. They're not great dancers, and they're not great musicians. The music is just loud, new age, junk, similar to what I imagine Yanni or John Tesh probably plays
0	A Big Letdown The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating. Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie. This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes. As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present. All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody. Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more. Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic. However, the overall impression is that of boredom. The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality. Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD. The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess.
1	Slammin' Cuts Str8 Outta Texas Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire. This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel. The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs. Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments. They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track "Feds in Town" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. "Super Tight..." is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it. Don't sleep on this classic
0	Well, At Least It's Better Than Brave New World!!! When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs. Some of them seem like they were written for her. Wild Card has a few good songs on it. The title track is okay. Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better. The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco. Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music. He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas. Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World
1	T-Bone's Spiritual Sons If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, "Two Bones and a Pick" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven. I can, and do listen to this for hours on end. If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two. T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat
1	His best yet I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs. By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book "Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music." It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album
1	Sing your fool head off! This album has become surprisingly influential. It was the first album to feature celebrities singing badly. I remember the first time I heard it; I laughed my head off. It spawned three sequels and several imitations. Hey, it even helped revive William Shatner's career! Of course, Shatner's unforgetable renditions of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; are the highlights here, but there's much more. Shatner's first mate, Leonard Nimoy, who was the most prolific actor/vocalist (five albums!), has two amazing contributions here. Everybody's favorite butler, Sebastian Cabot, has two songs from his spoken word album where he overacts Bob Dylan lyrics. Speaking of overacting Bob Dylan songs, you should here what Eddie &quot;Green Acres&quot; Albert does to &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;. Jack Webb recites &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in his best Joe Friday monotone. I could go on and on, but I will get to the point and say that &quot;this album is hilarious&quot;. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes funny music
1	Stealing Slow Kate always reminds us of what the best southern music is really about. In this fusion of southern atmospherics and blues, she touches the heart as few can in shades of country, gospel, folk and pop. UP IN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE COLD COAL MINES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES FROM BUFFALO TO BALTIMORE TALK ABOUT HARD TIMES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES This may be the best record in her distinguished discography. Kate's voice, sweet and thick as molasses, is as wonderful as ever and remains center stage with a cast of amazing musicians (including: Walt Aldridge-producer and guitars; Jim Hoke-accordion and harmonica, Larry Franklin-fiddle, Randy Kohrs-dobro, Neil Rosengarden-trumpet, Bill Huber-trombone, Ron de la Vega-cello) and a who's who of harmony singers (Maura O'Connell, Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, Mac McAnally, and Cindy Walker). Although the blues permeate nearly every song (often in very original ways), Kate finds hope as well. THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MUSIC TO EASE YOUR WORRIED MIND WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GUITAR CRYING IN THE NIGHT WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES PEACE COMES STEALING SLOW FALLS LIKE SILENT SNOW SWINGS DOWN SWEET AND LOW PEACE COMES STEALING SLO
1	Your stupid mouth will get you in trouble. I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.
0	Release the movie score. The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for "Once Upon a Time in America" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released
1	Armchair Anthropology I have seen the movie and bought the sound track. Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black, blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they paste up, &quot; Feinman Lives&quot; Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child. This record is strange and profound. Irresistable for any thinking person
1	Just as good Most artists or groups suffer the notorious sophmore flop. (1st Lp off the hook, second not even close) However, I felt like they've improved off their first release. Beatwise this is one of the most head-noddin albums they've dropped. Production was flawless. Lyrics seem to have improved as well. Go cop this and support quality hip hop music. A+
0	no? so i really liked new nathan detroits...i kept listening, hoping for more. what i got was a listless drone of alternative sounding chords and alkaline trio style vocals. i suppose i didnt give the album much of a chance... but when i have to stop listening to it twice because it bores me so much, i dont feel like i need to. the album appeared to have potential...but nothing stuck out except for the first track. everything just ran together, and it was difficult to seperate any sort of melody in any of the songs. compared to all the other reviews, i am apparently missing something, but i didnt like it. i heard it directly after listening to appleseed casts' &quot;end of the ring wars&quot;, which was amazing. so i guess would recomend that over this anyday. i will give this album another chance, simply because everyone else seems to like it so much, but as for right now, it gets a big juicy thumbs down
0	I Don't Understand Why This Is So Loved I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime
1	dancing fantasy is blue knights ,red knights ,and colors in motion the group of dancing fantasy ,blue knights ,red knights are together .looking for the cd os straight from the heart to complete the whole collection of the group.
1	Top Notch The greatest thing about this LP is the songwriting. Sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing, dealing with mortality and being average. I think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on Other Songs he creates a great diversity and depth. Mitchell Froom's production is perfect for the songwriting (it's almost as good as Kiko)
0	What's all the fuss... Not terrible, but I don't get the hype. To me, it's just New Wave Disco-and Disco was bad in the 70's. Finally, what's this doing in a "Power Pop" category? No freaking way is this remotely Power Pop! What a disgrace to Power Pop lovers
0	Hard to listen to. I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T
0	what are these official reviewers thinking? this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more, as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better
1	Prefection in 11 songs Like each colored brush-stroke makes a Van Gogh, this song is a masterpiece in 11 songs
0	Now More Than Ever....THIS SUCKS!!!! I was super excited when I bought Joann Rosario's first CD "More, More, More." Every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship. I was just as thrilled when I found out she had a new release, "Now More Than Ever...Worship." I heard one of her singles, "God" and figured I HAD to buy the cd when it came out. But boy was I disappointed when I popped it in my cd player!!! The only stand out tracks are: Track 3: Thanks Be Unto God Track 6: I Hear You Say Track 13: God The Bonus Track: Cuando Reposo En Ti All of the other tracks are barely mediocre. It was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight. I am extremely upset that I wasted $20 on this piece of junk. I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is "Worship," but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!! Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!! A feeble effort by Joann. This will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, as it did mine.
0	Dan The Automator ruins it. Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator. Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had. I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore? For shame! The horror!). The album itself is flat except for a few high points - "Paint" is good, "The Beast" is funky enough, "Never Called You Crazy" is good, and "All Behind You Now" is a great song, or would be live. That's about it. The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime. Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records
0	John Fogerty Premonition Is The Best DVD To Own A Dream Come True I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and makes me rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call my Collector's Edition dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition.
1	Harry Potter 3 Still haunting and mysterious just as the first two, this would have to be my most favorite out of the Harry Potter installments. Each track on this soundtrack gives you a clear idea of how the movie is like in your head, having the same theme of the last two movies, but making it more eerie and more amusing to listen to it. Having loud tracks, some tracks are beautiful; such as Track 6 and Track 15. I'm very happy that most of the tracks are over 2 minutes long, not having to change the track in like a minute and able to enjoy the melodic score. John Williams is an excellent composer. I highly recommend this to anyone! 1. Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme) 5/5 2. Aunt Marge's Waltz 4/5 3. The Knight Bus 4/5 4. Apparition on the Train 5/5 5. Double Trouble 5/5 6. Buckbeak's Flight 5/5 7.

1	Doris Day Christmas Collection Just like Perry Como..Doris Day does the same her Christmas songs take me back in time.. And I searched for this Album on the internet the best price was Amazon Thank you agai
1	Bob Dylan Rocks with the Band Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live "Before the Flood" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by "Blood on the Tracks," but it's been years now and still "Planet Waves" stands the test of time. I really like this record
0	Mega Craptitude this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America!
0	Jeff Bates Leave the light on I never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and I hope that he keeps up the good work.He has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.A friend of mine bought one of his CD at one of his concerts and it was the best I have heard in a long time.Your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.The one song that really stood out alot to me was Mama was alot like Jesus.I think that it should be your next release.It's a very touching ballad and I think people will want to hear more.A new and dedicated fan.Gerarda Watso
1	Just what our pool needed! The Aquatics Director wanted the atmosphere at our club pool to provide a "California Summer" feel. The Surfin' sounds of the Ventures really hit the spot...and made me feel young again
1	Back to my childhood Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15. Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life. I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life
0	Moving smartly along ... Well, let's put it this way ... I bought this when the vinyl was first released. Went with all the other APP albums I had. My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend. I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl. Not this one. For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars. Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars. I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky. But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me. On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy. A rollicking good time
0	A Rhino Dissapointment-Very Incomplete What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc? I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a &quot;couldve been great&quot;.....
1	Some good songs For the money this cd is great. Some good songs, #'s:1,2,8,9,10 and the NOFX song at the end is great. Its definitelyworth the money. But if it were 13 bucks I would be so sur
1	I Listened, Mouth Agape Wire was a blassed anomaly in the punk world, denying all attempts to categorize them as anything but brilliant. &quot;Artpunk&quot;? nah... &quot;Progpunk&quot;? nope... See, nothing works. Amazing &amp; very influential stuff. REM &amp; the Minutemen both have publicly praised the genre-bending work of Wire
1	The Best Jazz Album I've Bought in a Few Years! It's a thrill when a veteran musician puts it all together and every track is a keeper. Jimmy Smith plays to his strengths (great organ riffs) and gets help from a lot of equally talented friends. GREAT vocals on this album, sax and guitar. A real pleasure, among my top jazz albums. If you you're a long time jazz fan or looking to buy your first jazz album, Jimmy Smith DotCom Blues ought to be on the top of your want list
0	A poor man's NOW Compilation If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player. but if your children are six and up. Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs. This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it. This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap. Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old. pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa. This is Pop music for impoverished folks
1	The Best singer you've never heard of..... I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's. At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days); then I distinctly heard Hank; on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days). All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams. But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride. If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so. As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet. Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off. While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts: "I Gotta Get Drunk", "The Last Song I'll Ever Sing", and "Shoot The Buffalo" all showcase his voice. And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding "Fraulein" and "Who'll buy the Wine". This is one of those albums you have to own; and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++
1	completely thrilled me and surprised me! Usually i'm not the greatest Gloria Estefan fan, but this cd utterly won me over! I'm not a super english Gloria Estefan fan, but her spanish cd's have captivated my heart. When i decided to buy this cd, i was waiting for your typical dance music. I was really glad to hear good spanish music because now a days we lack that. Every time i hear it (whether i'm doing homework, easy listening, or reading)I want to be Cuban (de la patria) and dance salsa forever! She moves me-if not her, then definitely her music/orchestra. Beautifully arranged, perfect timing, and a glorious attack of Cuban beat/rhythm/love/spice/energy!!! After this cd, i bought all her other spanish cd's immediately (like Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas) but nonetheless, this cd (Alma Caribena) beats them all! :
1	Don't miss this one, it rocks Game on, this is good stuff! To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom, But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring. It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all. But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all. But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well. This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect. This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls. The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship. Those are rare commodities in today's music industry. Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom.
0	Nelly and Chingy represent all that is wrong with rap First of all what kind of name is Nelly? It sounds about as bad-ass as the Bee Gee's. And although Nelly isn't as bad as Chingy or Feminem, he isn't much of an improvement either. The lyrics are stupid, and often ridiculous (uh, 'Hot in Herre' anyone?), and he would go as far as rapping about sneakers, in that horrible excuse of a rap 'Air Force Ones'. 'Pimp Juice' has to be the worst song I've ever heard, well, next to 'The Real Slim Shady' by Butterfinger, er, Eminem. Nelly looks like a freakin' gorrila! And that stupid bandaide doesn't help him too much either. If I had to pick the five worst rappers in history they would be as follows: 5. Ludacris 4. Fat Joe 3. Nelly 2. Chingy 1. Eminem Nelly at 3...it doesn't take a genius to figure out that buying this is a bad decision. Jesus! Nelly makes 50 Cent look like Eazy E
1	Breathtaking Simplicity... Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks ("The Lake" and "The Horror Is Gone") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, "Fistful of Love", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish. Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library
1	Amazing studio-CD of Zucchero This is a studio-CD with more songs then on the live DVD of the ZU & CO performance in The Royal Albert Hall. It is a pleasure to listen to the high quality songs (solo and harmony) of Zucchero with world famous artists like Sting, Mouse, Pavarotti, etc. Drive in your car for hours and hours listening to this CD and you never want to stop

1	maiden keeps on churning out the greatness once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece. aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever, followed by the live favorite 2 minutes to midnight another solid rocker. the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs, that are all pretty much straight forward rockers. then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions. then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner, the second best epic they have. this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden. UP THE IRONS!!
0	A top three disappointment this year. Kasey's foray into the pop genre doesn't really bother me, and she certainly isn't selling-out either.This release however just doesn't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had. Not much more to say exept that this, along with Allison Moorer, & Randy Rogers Band are my 3 biggest let-downs of this year
0	Bad beyond imagination The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion. The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like. These guys have zero talent and zero class
0	Buy the cd not the single I have listened to this cd many times and every time I listen to the single it just makes me mad. The album version is a lot better and I wonder why Moby would want join forces with Gwen. The cd's version is unbelievable and I was happy to hear it become a single. I did not like Moby teaming with Gwen. Buy the cd and see how much better Moby as an artist. The music is much better and worth the money
0	bad recording I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede
0	Rip Off Two CDs that would fit on one and at a double price. Get another collection
0	The worst of Ofra Haza. Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of "Slave Dream" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away
0	CD not compatible with car CD player. I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player.
0	Skip this one, but see him play live. If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal. The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist. Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it
0	Mediocre The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause
0	I've got some issues with this CD First of all, Jump is too good of a track. I still haven't heard the rest of this CD because I just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute. It ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if I'm at a long light, I look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice, but like I've always told people, if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong, I don't want to be in prison. The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level
