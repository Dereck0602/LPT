1	Finally, I'm starting to win This DVD is terrific. Rather than describe the content, as most have, I'll discuss the results. I'm a rookie that plays with friends every couple of weeks. I've been playing for less than a year. I hadn't been a very winning player for a while, but went to Vegas recently. I watched this DVD and studied the Pre-Flop Strategy, Odds Chart and Hold'em Race Odds charts, and decided to take a chance and enter a low-dollar tournament. What a blast- I finished 11th out of 51 players. The next night, I entered another tournament. I made it to the final table and placed in the money- 7th. Wow, I thought I was going to be taken to the cleaners, but did pretty well against some clearly more experienced veterans. After returning from the trip, I immediately beat my friends, two games in a row. I had been getting my butt kicked by them for a couple of months now, so needless to say, this video has really turned my game around. I didn't realize how much I misunderstood about the game until I watched this video. I'm doing things in reverse order- now I'm going to purchase the first DVD to make sure I get the basics down, to add to these advanced techniques
1	Two Good Pairings This disk contains two westerns, both staring Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. The pair works well together in very different roles. The first is a comedy and the second is a drama. In the first they are buddies, in the second they are enemies. In both, they are splendid. Individual reviews appear below: THE CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUB This One's a Hoot Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda play a couple of cowboys working on the range. When Stewart gets a letter he is surprised to learn that his bother has died and left him his business. It is a placed called the Cheyenne Social Club. So it is that Stewart and his sidekick, Fonda, set out for Wyoming with the expectation of becoming respectable business men. Upon arrival, Stewart learns that he is the most popular and respected man in town. He also learns that his social club is a brothel. This strikes him as not being "in his line of work" and he determines to close the place down. That takes him from being the most respected to the most reviled man in town. He has some hard decisions to make and even more trouble appears when he learns that there are contractual agreements between his shop and the railroad. Things get more complicated still when he learns that there are some ruffians roughing up some of his girls. Stewart is just a nice guy trying to do the "right thing". Eventually, he does...much to his own surprise. FIRECREEK Sometimes the Little Guys Win This is another pairing of Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in a western. Stewart plays a farmer, respected by his peers and given the honorary title of sheriff in his town. The tile also comes with a home made tin badge and 20 dollars. It is a sign of esteem and nothing more. Fonda plays the leader of a group of gunmen with vague notions about law and order. When passing through town, they decide to stop there a little while and rest. Nobody really minds that but they do object to being treated like vermin by the gunmen who get a bit wild when they drink. Fonda does not really approve of what they do but is reluctant to come down on them too hard for fear of alienating them. That means that it is up to the sheriff to keep order. Keeping order is a hard job. He is not trained and he is certainly no gunfighter. He is just a farmer. The townspeople encourage him just to ignore things in the hope that the bad guys will eventually go away. All are frightened. When a friend is lynched, though, Stewart decides that enough is enough and takes on the whole gang. This is one of those films in which the little guy manages to stand up to the bully, survive and even win. It comes at a cost, though.
0	2 stars for cameos A dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the US and abroad. I was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen, but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target, I think it's just a shame. The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin, but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight. The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many.
1	Loved it as a kid and I still do................ Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.
0	Preview it before you show it. I bought this for my SciFi class. We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film. It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach. Everyone was so disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up. The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff. Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long. Bela Lugosi is a much better bet. For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans
0	Hold your nose I thought Colin was sleeping at first. I didn't realize he was "acting sensitive". It would be more interesting to watch paint dry, than this slow, boring, pointless movie. So, his friend is gay, big suprise, and Colin movies to New York to live with him and kooky girl. Who ever thought Robin Wright could look ugly? She used to be an attractive girl, I guess living with Sean Penn must be very stressful. You probably guessed the plot - kooky girl really loves gay friend, but Colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the "unconventional life" thats even more boring than living in the "burbs". They are the most conventional "unconventional" bores of all time. Either overdose on black coffee or skip this one. For extreme Colin fans only. Enjoy!
0	DEAR MORONS AT PARAMOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My question for the Morons at Paramount is why do possibly glue the sticker seals the container with such strong stuff that you cannot avoid ruining the container when you remove it. May I remind that this a COLLETOR'S ITEM!!!!! Therefore if you damage it is WORTHLESS
1	&quot;To fight fascism you have to be a communist.&quot; One of the most notorious espionage stories of the 20th century involves several members of Britain's upper crust. While Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, and Donald MacLean attended Trinity College, Cambridge, in the 1930s, they were recruited as spies by the Soviet government. All of the men subsequently gained prestigious jobs and successfully passed secrets to the Russians for several decades. The four-hour television mini-series, &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, concentrates on the characters of the spies, and how the society they were part of allowed them to flourish. The film begins with Trinity College, Cambridge in the 1930s. Hitler's power is on the rise, and fascism manages to impress a certain segment of the British upper classes. In response to the rise of fascism, many are attracted to communism. Blunt and Burgess are members of an elite club--the Apostles--and they are both committed communists when they meet and become involved with Donald MacLean and Kim Philby. The four men form a tight bond, which remains even after they leave university. Philby and Burgess both held high positions in MI6, and MacLean became a diplomat. Blunt--a distant relative to the royals--was knighted and became the Royal Curator of Art for the Queen. &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; succeeds in showing how these men were attracted to communism in the first place. They all came from wealthy, privileged backgrounds, and involvement with communism was a reaction against that, and also a reaction against fascism. The film shows the political and social atmosphere in which the &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; made their commitment to communism. The film is also extremely successful in showing the 'old boy network' that existed, and which, in effect managed to protect the spies. They were simply beyond suspicion and beyond reproach. Guy Burgess (Tom Hollander in an amazing performance) is a volatile extrovert with a penchant for self-destruction. Kim Philby (Toby Stephens) is much more controlled, and he seems the more rational of the bunch. MacLean (Rupert Penry-Jones) is another loose cannon, and Blunt (Samuel West) enjoys his connection with his royal relatives far more than he anticipated. While I deplored the misguided actions of the spies, it seems quite plausible that at least two of the four men (Blunt and Burgess) lived to really regret their youthful decision to convert to communism. But they found themselves stuck in a lifetime commitment before they realised the consequences. Blunt and Burgess seemed to truly love England, and their involvement with the Soviet government is sadly ironic. &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; is really is an incredible story. The plot sticks more or less to the truth--although some details are not quite accurate. The most glaring deviation concerns the defection of Guy Burgess. DVD extras include a documentary, and there's also a 'scrapbook' with TV tidbits about each of the spies--displacedhuman
0	Very Disapointed When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time.
0	Campy Horror Film Falls Flat Even though originally titled, "Andy Warhol's Dracula", this film had very little to do with Andy Warhol. Udo Kier plays a count visitng Italy to satisfy his "special diet", i.e. "virgin blood." Though the royal family's daughters seem promising, Joe Dellesandro (who uses the Andy Warhol style of "non acting")is busy making them ineligible for the Count's requirements. The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror. Though not as amazingly awful as "Sins of the Fleshapoids" or Ed Wood (who has a certain charm) Blood for Dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next
0	Not a family movie. Despite the cute sounding description, this is not a family movie. The constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine. The idea of the movie was a good one but once again Hollywood messed it up. We were very disappointed and threw the video out.
1	Relevant and Thought-Provoking Although this is an inaccurate adaptation of the original, it seems best to interpret this film on its own merit. Those who have read the novel will find this difficult, but others are in for a treat. Although somewhat shocking at first, this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing. This film has aged well, given the current political climate and world events. Here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of WWII and Cold War-styled propaganda. Unfortunately, the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope. Visually, the film is spectacular. The score by Basil Pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best I have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks. Despite this recommendation, I should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent, with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted. An interesting aside, probably not well known outside Australia, is that Australian politician Pauline Hansen (One Nation) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the Federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign (accusations of fascist leanings by her critics)
1	The product of a bygone era in movie-making... In "Lassie Come Home," "National Velvet," and "The Courage of Lassie," Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ... Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five Academy Awards... As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity... Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young Liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men... Anticipating her later images of young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both saintly and mature... Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.' Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle... From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, "National Velvet" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making... Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance... The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream... Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern...
0	The pits I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan but I simply can't say anything good about this film. The plot is horrible, the acting unconvincing (even Berenger), the dialouge laughable and the ending, well, sour to say the least. The pits
1	superb Very good movie. Great acting & plot. Very touching. I am very glad I own this movie. I will watch it very often
0	It killed an evening that needed to die, anyway. Thank God I borrowed this one from the library! Every time I saw a spinning propeller I thought of what my WWII veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes. I couldn't even enjoy the battle scenes because of the technical anomalies and anachronisms. It did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped
0	It's a PERFECT example of today's horror movies Which isn't a good thing. If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed? Please, give me a break.
1	Catastronic This musical is riviting. It lets your imagination run wild. It is something for young and old to enjoy. A must see
1	Great Movie I was told to watch this film my a college professor many years ago and has since became one of my favorite films. I highly advice this movie for anyone interested in apartide issues
0	The Last Picture Show Meets Von Ryan's Express Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one. Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone. The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often
1	Oscar nominated screen play, should have won. I give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture. Otherwise, it would earn a resounding five stars. I have been waiting a long time for this film to be on DVD, but to find that they are insulting Robert Ryan again by providing poor quality DVDs of many of his films now on DVD. Most recent example in Billy Budd, which I also have been waiting to be on DVD for eons. Both The Naked Spur and Billy Budd should have been given first class treatment. Naked is only marginally superious to the VHS due to the soft picture (Mann's other Westerns have been transferred better). MY VHS copy of Billy Budd is superior to the DVD. I definitely won't buy the DVD. Another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of Billy Budd were deleted in order to fit it on the DVD. I wonder which scenes they were. As for The Naked Spur, it is another Ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality. It is amazing how an actor such as Ryan can interpret malevolence so well, yet be a peace activist in real life. When Ryan's Ben Vandergroat cooly murders Jesse Tate, his deep seated cold bloodedness, which has only been talked about up to that point in the film, occurs at the moment when Ben kills Jesse. Ryan's final line to Janet Leigh as he lays in ambush for James Stewart and Ralph Meeker encapsulates his situation: "Pretty soon Roy and your friend Howie are gonna show up. Then I'll get me some more insurance against dying young.
1	Robin Hood (Disney Classic) Its just one of those movies you like to have in your library and I love good old classic cartoon movies. Such a fun movie to watch and enjoy with the family
1	Excellent Continuing the high standard set by the quality of episodes from the third season, season 4 of Star Trek: The Next Generation maintains a high standard throughout. The conclusion of the previous season's cliff-hanger "The Best of Both Worlds" does not disappoint, it's the rollercoaster finish we were all hoping for. It doesn't end there though, the writers were brave enough to not have the next episode be "back to normal" as Star Trek is so good at doing but write a real character episode "Family" mainly dealing with Picard's trauma after being assimilated by the Borg. There aren't any terrible episodes this season, Qpid is a bit silly with the crew as Robin Hood characters - most of the stories are strong. "Future Imperfect" continues the brinkmanship between the Federation and the Romulans (with Andreas Katsulas of Babylon 5 fame and Riker telling Picard to "shut up"), "Data's day" is an entire episode from Data's perspective, "The Wounded" introduces us to the Cardassians, "First Contact" is what Star Trek's all about, then we get into "The Mind's Eye" and "Redemption" where the Romulan, Klingon and Federation triangle plot finally starts to come out.
0	It watched it on fast forward! Except for two cuties: William Zabka and Dana Ashbrook! Especially Dana who constantly having a hard-on
1	Excellent Guide I ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200. Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense. There are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the D200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos. I highly reccommend it
1	A LESSON TO REMEMBER... This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes. They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise. The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship. Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner. While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation. Still, the film manages to entertain, notwithstanding these shortcomings
1	Ah, to be twentysomething in Seattle in the early 1990s! This film genuinely surprised me when I first saw it in theaters in 1992. For me, Bridget Fonda was the main draw at the time, as she received top billing and was on the movie posters with Matt Dillion. It felt like a bait and switch, because the film focuses more on Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick's relationship, even though they aren't featured on the poster. That's no biggie, because I enjoyed their storyline much more than Bridget and Matt's...but I bet Campbell and Kyra weren't happy to be excluded on the poster/DVD cover. This film has it all...great music suitable to the period (grunge/alternative), fantastic use of place (Seattle in a starring role), interesting and quirky characters, and true to life portrayal of young people in their twenties negotiating through life as they find their true passions. I especially loved Campbell Scott's performance and he is the true star of this film. His job is working on creating a "Super Train" to get Seattlites out of their cars and onboard for their commute, because he believes that "if you give them great coffee and great music, they'll ride." His girlfriend, played by Kyra Sedgwick, has her pulse on the masses, by telling him, "I still love my car, though." She's an environmentalist who drives an old gass guzzling clunker of an automobile, which Campbell pokes fun at after a lunch date. Its a joy to watch their relationship grow from initial doubts to lover games about how soon after a date one should call to other challenges that crop up. I especially love the scene when Linda (Sedgwick) peruses Steve's (Campbell Scott) record albums and gets nostalgic about her college days. That scene epitomizes the exciting "getting to know you" stage of dating and rings absolutely true. The choice of music in that scene, and throughout the entire movie really enhances the scenes overall. Probably the only thing I didn't like about the film, which is just a tiny critique, was Janet's (Fonda) almost groupie-like infatuation with Cliff (Dillon), who didn't seem all that interested in her (until she moves on with her life). They are a mismatched pair if there ever was one...Janet with her ambitions for Grad School to pursue architecture, and Cliff the stereotypical Gen X slacker working menial jobs to support his rock band career that probably wouldn't have gone anywhere. Janet should have hooked up with the plastic surgeon who doesn't know how to have fun! This dvd would be made even better with a director's commentary track. Cameron Crowe could divulge a lot of interesting information and insite jokes that the average filmwatcher might not catch (like when the mime says, "wooo woooo woooo" in response to a guy who says he works for Boeing, or when a reporter asks Cliff what the song "Touch Me, I'm Dick" is about--which is an inside joke on the actual song "Touch Me, I'm Sick"). This film is so ingrained into the grunge culture of Seattle of the early 1990s, that future audiences could use a lot of background info a director's commentary would provide. At any rate, this film is a joy to watch, and cheaply priced that it's worth having in one's collection. And buy the soundtrack while you're at it
1	Pretty woman meets Leon. I thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting, with a budget probably no bigger than an average Jackie Chan movie. The ending was novel and Jet Li&#8217;s use of needles, to supplement his martial arts skills, added a fresh touch. Jet Li looks convincing, with respect to his characterisation. And Bridget Fonda looks good too.
0	Not recommended My husband and I were very disappointed with this DVD set. One DVD contains an "action documentary" with music - we did not like that DVD. We thought the second instructional DVD is mediocre and might be helpful if you are a complete novice. The treatment of subjects is in our opinion pretty superficial overall. There is little breakdown of technique. There is minimal race footage, which is helpful to watch to learn by watching experts. Parts of the footage seemed recycled - we heard very similar discussions about ski wax in the separate "tuning" and "equipment primer" sections. You cannot watch the DVDs straight through as they dump you back into a main menu after you complete a scene. So you must frequently fiddle with the controls to select scenes to watch. That feature is helpful if you want to access scenes easily perhaps but we did not like it. I am not usually a complainer but we were so disappointed with this set that I wanted to put up a review.
1	Very unusual for Hollywood I finally bought this movie recently and watched it last night and all i can say is..... FANTASTIC ENTERTAINMENT! Forget all the bad reviews in the press when the movie was in cinemas, this film is very good indeed. If you like non stop action and i really do mean from start to finish, and if you like cgi special effects, and explosions, and weapons, and monsters etc, then you will love this movie. It's a simple tale of good Vs evil, nothing more nothing less. It is pure entertainment, great fun, great value at under six quid and it's a film you will want to watch again, trust me
0	The Mothman Travesty Three problems with this film: 1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary. It's very boring. As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed. 2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging. The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes. Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole. The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting. 3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question. The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?" In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake. Don't waste your life. ALon
0	Too much to cover in too short a time This DVD functions more or less as an advertisement for the other SNL DVDs that have been and continue to be marketed by NBC. The 25th anniversary special on this DVD lasts 2.5 hours, which sounds like a long time, but it's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time. As uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year, there was still a lot of great material--far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way. As a result, the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites--often, just enough to cover a famous quote ("wild an crazy guys," etc.) with a touch of lead-in. This may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who's seen the skits, but that's about it. When the skits were originally aired, they usually went on too long, but here the DVD's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction. I'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of 25 years worth of programming that would fit on one DVD, but if it can't be done... maybe one shouldn't do it. The DVD comes with three "extras": an interview of Lorne Michaels by Tim Russert, which is mildly interesting; the "day-after" coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous TV show I never heard of, "Access Hollywood"; and promotional TV coverage by some other NBC news show, which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the DVD. Again I ask: Why put this material on a DVD? The so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party. All in all, disappointing. By the way, for those who care, the Beastie Boys don't actually perform a number on the DVD. They play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by Elvis Costello, and then they end up playing back-up for him
1	American Knitter learn how to knit 3 dvd set I just received this dvd set on tuesday and by thursday I have learned to cast on the proper way, knit, purl, increase, decrease, cast off, hold my yarn the proper way etc. etc. Tracy is the greatest!! I feel like I went from an insecure beginner to a confident intermediate knitter in just two days. I haven't even begun dvd lesson number 3, but I am secure in the fact that I will master it and become an intermediate or better knitter because of this awesome teacher. She is friendly, patient, and very pleasant and caring as she guides you through each step of the way. I hope she will put out another series where she teaches you to understand knitting patterns. Thanks Tracy!
1	Real Friendship This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.
0	Movie should include noose American Pie: an immature, mindless, vapid, boring, blandly disgusting, humor lacking piece of over-rated trash packed full of cliches, highschool sterotypes, annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade A douchebags.
0	THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACTED BETTER IF THEY USED REAL RETARDS!!!!!!! I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling "1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	19th Century Incredibles There have been far too many sequels to too many original films that were much more stellar. "The Legend of Zorro", unfortunately, is another. Whereas the 1998 original was more along the lines of a blockbuster, this 2005 sequel has proven to be lackluster. Antonio Banderas, as Alejandro De la Vega,has taken his late father-in-law's name, and is now more at ease in his role as a nobleman of mid-19th-century California. He is still donning the mask and making sojourns to help the oppressed and dispossessed of the region. But he now has a wife and child to consider and the tensions between the swashbuckler and his equally daring young wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones)mount when she begins to fear for the safety of their son, Joaquin. As Joaquin, Adrian Alonso reveals that the genes for the spunk and cunning of the De La Vegas have not worn thin as he defies authority to help defeat the villians of the film. At intervals, the family become the 19th century's precursor to the animated Incredibles with the skills and technology available to them. As another reviewer noted, the story loses its credibility when Elena and Alejandro divorce due to her concerns for her son's safety. This would have been extremely rare in the 19th century, and unheard of in a Catholic country at that time. Elena reunites with a former acquaintance she met during her years in Spain, a French nobleman named Armand(a piercing-eyed, striking Rufus Sewell) in whose house she and her son become guests, and whom Elena finds to have sinister designs on California, not unlike the abductor she had believed to be her father for many years. The "Zorro" franchise recycles Tony Amendola as a priest trying to teach students such as Joaquin, whereas he had been a devious henchman to Don Rafael in the 1998 film, and lets us glimpse Mary Crosby, a quarter century after the height of her popularity, in a non-speaking role as a Governor's wife, reassuring us that there are no small roles, only small actors. While it has a few impressive moments, the script is a tired rehash of the original theme, and the outcome is predictable, literally hinging on the ability to get on the right track. Young Adrian Alonso appears to have a bright future ahead of him, and I hope that Antonio and Catherine enjoyed their onscreen reunion. But generally, it simply does not have the sizzle of its 1998 predecessor, and there was a lot of time and money that could have been better spent
1	Rio Grande: The start of a great pairing Rio Grande was conceived as a movie to pay for the making of another film. John Ford wanted to make a little film called "The Quiet Man" but Columbia Studios wanted a quick money maker to pay for the next production. The result was "Rio Grande." A classic in its own right, one that should not be missed. Directed by John Ford and starring Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne together for the first time. The story is what hyou should expect from Ford, good action and get characters. Look for many familar faces in this film, like Victor MacLagen, Chill Wills, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This film is part of the fabled cavalry trilogy. It is rousing and exciting. Atrue classic, don't miss it
0	Worth a rental Let me start off by saying, I have not seen the orignal Wicker Man. This movie kept me guessing all the way through, which earns it one star. I couldn't tell if Willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting. I did enjoy Ellen Burstyn's performance as the "Queen Bee" so to speak. So many unanswered questions or things that didn't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie. I am generally not a fan of neat, tidy, happy endings, so that wasn't a problem for me, but the numerous loose ends were. Worth a rental, but probably not worth purchasing
0	Pornographic trash Think this is a 'fun' sampler of B movies? Think again. Contains offensive pornography. Not terribly sexually explicit but full of violent and degrading situations. I feel guilty giving it 1 star, but that was the lowest rating available
1	Why do space men get all the fun? This movie is a classic, u have so many great actors in this movie... You know, I loved this movie the first time i saw it as a kid and it was better the seccond time...
1	Good melodrama, fine leading performance, handsome production For all the care they put into this fine, textured story of a pedophilia scandal in a Catholic orphanage in 1970s Newfoundland, the filmmakers can't let go of the conventional dichotomy of child abuse dramas: grim, teeth-gnashing villains and righteous, just-folks heroes. It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama. Henry Czerny, though, gives a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part. And the Canadians go further than American filmmakers ever could or would, suggesting how available the boys' bodies are, and what could be attractive about them. Finally, the whole snowbound, wood-paneled production is goregous to look at. Subject matter aside, if you doubt that Canada is a distinct place from the United States, take in the sights, sounds, and attitudes of this small epic
0	broken . The breakdance trio are back . this time around they're trying to stop the demolition of a community center. And at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly's - Lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone's - adolfo quinines - feelings towards Kelly and turbo's - Michael chambers - love interest . If the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and bad costume design . even ICE T sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents. But , If you liked the first movie , like me , then you can't resist buying this sequel. at least you'll see turbo's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly's not that bad acting . Otherwise avoid .
1	Here Is A Classic! In the midst of Widower (Mortician?) (Colin Firth), Cedric Brown's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny, hairy warts and all. With her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth, she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane. If childrearing were this easy, us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick! (I noticed Emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere). Can I please borrow it, Ms. Thompson? My daughter and I were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself, Emma Thompson. It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her? Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed. Beware of dark undertones if you're wary of witchcraft. This review refers to the DVD
0	Bridges of Madison County DVD The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault). I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed. It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing. The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open. But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house. That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case. Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you. The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little
0	cliche ridden ... I like Dennis Hopper and love Frederick Forrest. Neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with. They seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines. Sad to see such great talents wasted in a film filled with gratuitous violence and terrible "pop psychology" dialogue. Was there a point to this film
0	i thought anthony minghella was incapable of making a worse movie than "the english patient" ... oops, mine bad!
0	Oscar Wilde Lite As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach. The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility. This film is too jolly and innocent. Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty. I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth. Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it. If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated
0	This is not &quot;Drunken Master&quot; don't buy this movie... this is NOT drunken master. the two fellas who gave this 5 stars had to be thinking of the REAL drunken master. i bought this w/o previewing it and saw that Jackie Chan wasn't in the movie at all, it was a crappy movie and then all of a sudden they'd squeeze in a jackie chan clip out of nowhere. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. don't make the same mistake that i did. instead, try &quot;young master&quot; with subtitles
1	DINOSAUR LONGEVITY AND SCIENTIFIC FACT The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Give me a break This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker
0	Add To Cart.... NO! This movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas. Anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life. The plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those Silver Shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that ANYONE can make a movie. I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids
0	The worst Pixar movie ever I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you
1	A step into the past. i remember the good old days, watching labrynth or dark crystal as a kid. this is the one that started it all. i dont quite know why but from that time till today there has been no better devil either. great movie to remind you of those good old times. an absolutely wonderful classic
1	great b grade horror! I went into watching this film a little aprehensive. I love horror movies but 99% are usually never scary in the least bit. (usually they are just very fun to watch) This movie was creepy as hell and has a high amount of tension that continues to build. It actually freaked me out which is very hard to do. this film and malevolance are the only 2 horror films to give me that gut feeling of fright that I crave from this genere of movies in about the past year or so. My dog even started growling at the tv and barking being the savage gaurd dog that he is. If you love horror films than this one is a must see, the story is very similar to and is basicly a mix of wrong turn and the texas chainsaw massacre, and they pull it off very wel
0	Pointless The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring. The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing. The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other. Not my idea of a good time
1	3 times through After watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects (geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line) or that it is a complete mess. I admit that I enjoyed what I thought was mindless entertainment, but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what I thought was a Hollywoodish Anime (not a good thing). However I was fortunate to see one OVA at a time, therefore I watched the first OVA about three times, the second two times and at last all three together (these three are what make up the contents of this DVD). So by the time I finished this first half of the story I pretty much understood it. This DVD entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story. Honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in. It appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once; however I believe that is what he intends. As the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine (OVA to OVA). So expect the first OVA to be the most complicated and confusing. but if you Read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it. Finally, the animation and CG is second to none. It is an extremely beautiful anime. Sooo, I highly recommend reading the summery on the back of the box first
0	I hated this movie I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits
0	Very frustrated with fake accents!! As an avid Agatha Christie fan, I was thrilled to receive this movie as a gift for my birthday. I had watched the two other movies staring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot and absolutely LOVED them!! However, I was so bored and frustrated throughout this movie. Albert Finney was a terrible Poirot. I honestly could barely understand a word he and some of the other actors were saying. The accents were barely comprehendable. I had to play and replay the end where the mystery is solved. I am very upset my husband spent the money on buying this movie as I am sure that I will never be able to sit through it again. The plot was great, however, some of the acting was horrid. I am only giving it two stars because it is based on an Agatha Christie novel. Based on the film itself; no stars. If you can understand even half of what Albert Finney is saying, you're a better woman than I
1	Ghostbusters I & II (Double Feature Giftset) My son ask for this for Christmas (He's 17). He has watched these movies too many times to count. He can quote lines and he knows all the songs. I would rather my 17 year old watch these movies than some of the other movies out these
1	A Great Gospel Film I heard about this version of the life of Christ, but had never seen it. It is a striking black and white telling of the Gospel of Matthew. It is beautifully filmed (there are a few problems with subtitles, but you can follow the story just fine) movie, and very true to Matthew's gospel. As a pastor and a Christian, I highly recommend this moving video
1	Aftershock: Earthquake in New York real and live action I really liked this movie and felt it was well done with much suspense and action. It was like I was part of the whole movie. It brought back for me a feeling like it could really happen. It was true to NY and the people. The action and acting was really good. I enjoyed the movie and felt its a winner.
1	Tru takes on a 2nd season & the plot thickens When Tru Calling's pilot started I originally thought, "well, this show will be cancelled soon". it was messy, unoriginal & kinda lame. but that's how it was supposed to start. then the 2nd episode was more believable & was a little better in every area that Pilot lacked! & from then to the middle of the season, it had its high points & its lows, Closure being one of my fav episodes! then, enter Jason Priestley as Jack, I'm thinking, why on Earth is he on this show? they must be desperate or something. but his character suddenly started making the show more interesting, things started moving faster & the show became darker, there were more things going on in the episodes & by the finale, Tru Calling hit its high point! everything was looking good for the show! but had they started out that good, maybe Fox would've gave it a better promotion. One of my fav moments is in Death Becomes Her when Jack saves Harrison's car by calling the thief's bluff. & from that moment, you have to know there's something up with Jack. especially after the audience presumably found out that he got a girl to commit suicide by making a phone call to her parents telling them about her constant gambling. & then with some help from Tru, Davis has to re-find out what he did on day one & tell her that Jack also relives days which in the next episode we find out why. He's there to stop her! & after getting Luc(Mat Bomber) killed, he takes a vacation & hopes that Tru will stop saving lives that are suppose to die. but Tru doesn't give up & when Jack comes back, things start getting tricky. Perfect Storm- 5/5 Jack's return makes it difficult for her to save the life of a cop who died in a white squal but Jack sending her back out in the water at night makes it even harder after Davis saved her the first time by making a "phony" phone call. & Davis gets a replacement psychiatrist & things don't go so well with her. Grace- 5/5 Jack sets Tru up for murder & things hit rock-bottom before they get better for her. In the Dark- 4/5 In one of the more obvious deaths for the viewers anyway, Tru is forced to figure out who died after a party is thrown by her brother at the morgue. Jack keeps Tru on her feet & makes her go on a wild goose chase. The Last Good Day- 5/5 My fav episode of Tru Calling. Everything changes when Jack gets asked for help from a girl who commited suicide. now the only question was, why? & why does the relive day feel so cold to Tru? Enough- 5/5 Tru crosses the line when she tries to save life of her boyfriend Jensen as Jack tries to stop her & even Davis warns her of the reprecussions of saving the life of someone who doesn't ask for her help. She shouldn't be able to choose, it's up to fate. but she doesn't listen & something severe does happen in return. Twas the Night Before Xmas, Again- 4/5 Harrison finds out about his dad's alliance with Jack but before he warn Tru, her day restarts. Tru reluctantly lets Jack help her in solving a murder case possibly after an old cadaver asks for help. It's an ok ending cause it at least it isn't a cliff hanger but it's a shame it didn't get a whole season & stupid shows that shouldn't be around cause their just getting stupid(cough*the oc*cough) are still on??? but Fox screwed Tru Calling, see my review for the first season for more about how ticked off I am at fox, lol. plus some features on the show & I think anyone should get into this show! the second season could've been so great had they had a whole season! these six episodes are worth your money just the same! a memorable show too bad it wasn't given a real chance cause it did become something great!
1	what do you mean you LOST THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can still remember sitting down in front of the t.v. and watching the pilot movie as a kid and loving the idea of a superhero who was as lost about his powers as i felt about my 12 year old body at the time. funny and action packed this was a great show and i am glad to see that it has made it's way onto dvd. william katt,connie selleca,and the great robert culp star as the "team" of teacher ralph hinkley,bill maxwell,and pam davidson and they were a great team! one night ralph is driving and spots a light in the sky,as does bill(culp as the funny non bending f.b.i. man) the light is a spaceship and ralph is given a "supersuit" with a book to tell how to use the suit(which he loses at once) and as he and ramrod stright maxwell join forces to save the world,ralph must also find out how to work the "suit"! this is one of the best and most fun shows to come out of the early 80's and it was also one of the most over looked ones today. get this great action/comedy show and enjoy the tounge and cheek humor that is still fresh today. "look at what's happened to me, i can't believe it myself,who could it be,believe it or not it's just me" part of the theme song(a top 10 hit and one of the best theme songs ever for a show
