0	disappointed Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book. Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility. The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution
1	Good It is a good book recommended from Cuttle
0	Levenda's Leftist Lexicon This is now the third of Levenda's books I have read and the second in this particular series. As other reviewers have noted, by the end of this edition, the author's leftist political views and anti-Catholic epistemological perspective overwhelm the narrative to the point that credibility suffers. This is really rather sad, as Levenda is a talented writer, who has done, evidently, some significant research. Unfortunately, it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the Bush clan, whilst holding the hideous Clintons above reproach, and worse, misses no opportunity to villify the Church, while smiling at Wicca. The hypocricy is really breathtaking. Understand that, in the corpus of this text, there is much that is worthwhile, certainly entertaining, and well presented. It is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance. This volume ends, as did the last, not with a bang, but with a whimper. In fact, Levenda's last paragraph is, in its entirety, a quote from "The Book of Ceremonial Magic", of all things. We are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series. There is much else that cries out to be read. We may read the next in volume, if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored. But this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience.
0	Judson would be a demagogue, if he could get your attention. I would have given this no stars if it were an option. The first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me. Judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind, but only occasionally scientific fraud. He seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world, we will get fired up and join him in a lynching. His tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him. This is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with. He laces his information with references to "the epidemic" of fraud and nobody being "immune" to it, as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions. I suspect that Judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer.
0	Charlie should have burned the manuscript! I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown! It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter'

0	A profile in courage You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein. He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book. Wow, that's courage. That's a backbone. Let's see, Klein goes around slamming the Clinton presidency, anonymously. Thanks, Joe. America needs more brave souls like you. Go back to writing your drivel in Time Magazine. Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns.
1	Worth reading What can one say about this book that hasn't been said before? "Speaker for the Dead" is fundamentally different from "Ender's Game." Those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology, which is a welcome change of pace. "Speaker for the Dead" is by turns gripping, moving, frustrating, interesting, preachy and grossly manipulative. It's not perfect, but what is? Wise readers will stop the Ender series at the end of "Speaker for the Dead" and pretend that "Xenocide" doesn't exist. Don't say I didn't warn you

1	Change, Partenrships and Transformation Those of us in the change and transition business are vocal, loud and some would say, obnoxious advocates for recognizing the human side and impact of change. Too often our words fall on deaf ears...with &quot;True Partnerships&quot; we finally have a text that deals with NEW principles for relating to others during, before and after change. We finally have a text that deals with the potential destructiveness of autonomy, power, scarcity mentality and victimhood. Instead this book awakens a call to action for relationships that produce extraordinary results by shifting our philosophy to one of connection, communication, expansion and creator/observer. It is powerful, beyond words and is guaranteed to cause you to examine your own approach of &quot;drift&quot; versus &quot;true partnership.&quot; It can shake you up and transform your relationships at work, at home and everywhere inbetween. Read it and begin relating differently today
1	A MUST READ I love Greg Iles! Have been a fan since Spandau Phoenix - Mortal Fear is Iles' second offering and it is one of my all time favorite books. It deals with computer technology and a computer sex site - and a killer who is using it for his prey. The use of character developement is astounding and the tension is nonstop. For those who like Iles, and haven't read his earlier works, this is really a must read - if you are a fan of this genre and have missed this one - you will be thrilled
0	Not for the solo lawyer; not about marketing, except for the author I was disappointed by this book. I am a solo litigation attorney, and I read the book to get ideas on marketing. It gave me some ideas. Perhaps the most valuable idea was to focus more on customer service; Dahut has an interesting discussion about exactly what that means and how we can do it better. By and large, however, this is a book by and for big firm attorneys. It is about big firm angst and how it can be combated by hiring experts such as Dahut to do extensive consulting work for your firm. Dahut does not acknowledge, and does not care, that most attorneys are solos or work in small firms, and that we have very different issues than agonizing over whether we have lost our soul by conforming to much to dead firm culture
1	Grade school mental workout!!! This book is the best of its kind--nothing comes close to the number and variety of mental puzzles of various levels of difficulty...word games, optical tricks, math puzzles, et cetera. This book is amazing. I've given several to teachers. Excellent for third grade up to high school. The only thing I'd change about the book is the color: the book only has black, white, gray and blue
0	Too many cooks (even if they are good ones) spoil the broth This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA. Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc. If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan "Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care"
1	uplifting and positive This book is just the thing if you need a little - or a lot - of motivation to jump start your life. I read it during a difficult time two weeks ago and it made a difference - thank you
1	Thousand Pieces of Gold The film (one of my favorites) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual I found the book to be far superior to the film. The norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing. The book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting, as a factual historical novel. As a piece on racial discrimination and women's fight for equality it is the best of reading. For those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection.
0	Keynes' disorganized critique of the Versailles Treaty This book achieved instant fame when it was published in 1919, not only for its scathing criticism of the Versailles Treaty but also for its personal attacks against leading signatories (especially Clemenceau and Wilson). For a book focused primarily on economic concerns, the text is surprisingly easy to read. However, the book's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness. The principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the founder of 20th century style, gov't & debt driven economics. The book is organized into chapters on pre-war Europe, Allied statesmen, summary of key treaty points, reparations, post-war Europe predictions, and Keynes' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement. Unfortunately, within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason. (Is this indicative of Keynes' own personal organization and logical thinking?) Within the book, he makes a very practical (but politically infeasible) argument for a non-vindictive treaty. He basically suggests that the Allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other Allies, and instead they should settle (though not ideally) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only German gov't property. (Did the German gov't sponsor Keynes' work in writing this book?) Keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the German people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise. There is some logic in this point; however, later on he goes on to state that the US should forgive its $10 billion debt to its wartime allies ($5 billion of which was owed by the UK). Forgive me if I'm wrong, but doesn't such a move disincent American entreprises from entrepreneurship as well. It's extremely hypocritical that the Allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the US during the war and then once it was over to claim that they couldn't pay them. If they didn't want to repay, then they shouldn't have borrowed the money - period. (If I borrow money to buy a home, the bank won't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether I'm out of work, injured, or the house burns down. I don't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment.) Notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic, Keynes does produce a reasonable, brief list of treaty rememdies, especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Not until the advent of the Cold War and the interests of extending American political influence would Keynes' policies largely succeed (albeit yet again to the detriment of American taxpayers). Overall, I felt the book was ok. I would only recommend it if you have an interest in reading all of Keynes' work. Don't expect to find any theoretical economic insights in the book, though. Based on the high ratings on this page, I think the other reviewers here might have some pro-Keynesian bias

1	Last King of Scotland Very good, but don't expect the movie. Quite a few changes.
0	Leaves me cold This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years. It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered. It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are stereotypical creations of little or no interest. I was particularly amused when the detective was told to &quot;make a few inquiries at the transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the corpse&quot;. In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known &quot;transsexual shoe shop&quot;. Please. I suspect Ms. LaPlante has better material, but this is a poor example better left unread. I would give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option
0	these reviewers blindly regirgitate antiscience gibberish This book is garbage. Tell me of one documented case of human ill-effects from GMO's and maybe I will sway. Recently the Zambian gov't turned down 18000 tons of emergency grain from the US because it was GM. People died of starvation as a result. At least take the time to get the other side of the story before taking this book as the gospel truth. I respect Nader for alot of the things he has done. This book is certainly not on that list
1	Delicious, with a Wee Aftertaste Even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book, which is a compilation of several of MKF Fisher's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin, recipes, culinary preparation, and history. In addition, it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs, etiquette, ambience, socializing and so forth. But what makes this book stellar is the eloquent, imaginative, and sometimes even haunting style of Ms. Fisher's writing. She expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions, mixing them with historical facts, tempting recipes, and home-cooked tales. With such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers, it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining. I wish I had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food, eating, and drinking, which after all are such basic elements to our very existence. The section I enjoyed most of all was "The Gastronomical Me", a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes. She includes food episodes of her early years in California while growing up and later attending boarding school; in Dijon, France where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings; in Switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the Alps to Italy; and finally in a small Mexican town, where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories, by telling the most poignant tales. An interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food. You gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics, from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of Pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon, which she keeps in a flask during a long, propeller-driven, airplane flight to Mexico. The other sections I liked were the beginning (Serve It Forth) and Consider the Oyster. It amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster: the various types, methods of preparations, and culinary history. Plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too. You name it, she said it about oysters--recipes included. I did not care as much for How to Cook a Wolf, as I could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented. (Sorry, but sweetbreads, halves of calf heads, and brains were not appetizing subjects.) Also, I gave up finishing the book. I started to read "An Alphabet for Gourmets", the last section, but got as far as "D" and couldn't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet. It seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter, to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending. This section was such a let-down, a depressant to me after coming off the high of "The Gastronomical Me". Although I exaggerate, she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people (with untrained palettes) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second. Anyway, other readers may disagree with me, but this last section lacks the consistency, and more important, the vibrancy and pep of her flowing, off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections. Although I was a little disheartened at the end, her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives. I can recommend this book to everyone, especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat. Of course, foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it. And though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses, this should not be considered a cookbook; instead, this book's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy.
1	Great book - read it It's not a player book; I was looking at Christian based books on Dating & relationships and this book kept coming up. It explains women psychology in Dating
1	Women is a great, candid, easy to read, crazy book!! Bukowski writes so well in such an easy to read style that it is hard to put the book down. So I ended up reading this book in about a week. I'm reading Ham on Rye now and it's the same thing, addicting. You can't put the darn thing down because you want to see what happens next. He's like a print version of a reality-show.
1	Fantastic revealing look into the human soul Laskowski creates a amazingly insightful and poignant look into the mind and spirit of a man with a brain injury who lives in a group home in Montana. The novel explores Robert's relationships with his caregivers, his parents, his son, and his peers in prose that is honest, thorough, and poetic. Beyond being just a book about brian injury, this is a book about the general human condition, about someone wanting to be the best he can be, about someone trying to relate meaningfully with parents and child, about someone trying to navigate succesfully our confusing postmodern world. A must read
0	Not My Cup of Tea I know I'll get criticized for not "getting" this book. I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this. Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era. Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts. The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today. Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone.
0	Cradle and All Of all of James Patterson books he has written and I have read, this is the most disappointing one of all. Had I known beforehand what this one was about, I would not have bought or read it. Sorry, J.P. is too good a writer to put out this kind of trash. Just my opinion!!!!

It was THAT boring!!!!!!! i want to get the first book in this series and see whether it's bette
0	A Deceiving Title This sounds like an ideal book for a person with an eating disorder. But it heaps loads of guilt and condemnation on an already needy and suffering soul. The idea that over or undereating is sin is one concept. But the fact is that the individuals embroiled in this cannot help themselves. They are already people pleasers and perfectionists, how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help? They are already as good as they can get themselves to be. They are not bad--they are hurt and afraid. It has been said no one can overcome an eating disorder without the help of a therapist. This I believe. There are too many important issues involved in this DISEASE to dismiss it as sin. If the person knew the issues they would be a long way to getting help. God loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain. These are very good people. Heaping more condemnation on one beset with self-loathing is surely not the path to freedom. Adding God's displeasure to this already mountainous pile of self hate can only be damaging--perhaps pushing some over the edge. A good book to avoid!!
0	Tongue Tied Deaver's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound. He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white. In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle. This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan. The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom. As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons. 1. When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize. In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who "speak in tongues." And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be. 2. The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs. We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot. 3. Implausibility. There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess. 4. My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers. In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of "like"s and "way lame"s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake. I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous. If you want to try Deaver, check out The Devil's Teardrop or the Bone Collector. This is not worth the effort
0	Not for the beginner. I went to the same school as the author of this book, and so it was used for my introductory CMOS design class. The book has a lot of great material, but it was rather confusing to me as a beginner. Now that I'm a more seasoned designer, I can look back on this book as an excellent reference, but I STILL find the explanations somewhat confusing. It's clear that the author is a foremost expert on the subject, but he just has some trouble relaying the fundamentals to the novice designer
