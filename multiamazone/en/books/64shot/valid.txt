1	Fabulous Book What a wonderful book. Quite often, a book is real good until the ending, and then I'm let down, But this has a really good ending too. This tale is really excellent: a verbal piece of art. I liked all the lineage and interconnections in this large musical family. I learned what it's like to have mucic within you -- to write as well as perform. I liked the character developments -- no one all good or all bad, but all very interesting. I recommend this book highly. One learns about US history, country music, human nature, and it's entertaining to boot
0	Disappointing book and code on audio signal processing This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as "i suggest somebody to fix that" and "saves typing later". If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent "Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try "A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of "Musical Applications of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- "Digital Audio Signal Processing" and "DAFX"- in that order.
0	Hour Game is one of the worst books I've ever read This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile
0	Two surprises I didn't like The text of this book was generally good - although it seemed padded out with a massive listing of model metadata. The book comes with a CD. The first surprise was, the CD does not include the Data Definition Language (DDL) for its sample models... there's an extra cost for that. My question to the publisher would be, what good is the CD you provide for free? The second surprise is the illustrations. There are plenty of them, but they look like they were done in a primitive graphics package - not in an enterprise modeling tool. They author seems to have invented his own wierd set of conventions, including "foreign keys do not appear in the entities... that is duplicate information". Before you buy this book, take a look at the illustrations of the models. If you can live with the notation, maybe consider buying it
0	Don't read this without reading Matus Irvin Matus wrote the definitively researched text on Shakespearean authorship (Shakespeare, In Fact), and the Earl of Oxford fails completely as an alternative Bard. I wouldn't go around quoting Anderson's theories in the presence of anyone familiar with Matus' evidence. You'll get your head handed to you on a platter. Guaranteed. It won't be a fair fight
0	A powerful flop! The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on
1	Not quite what I was expecting A Journey to the Center of the Earth did not turn out to be quite what I was expecting; I can't say quite why, however, because I'm not entirely certain what those expectations were. I hadn't read the novel previously, but I thought I knew what it was about. As a result, I think I was expecting more drama than Verne delivers, or perhaps I simply wanted the book to be more than it is. Most likely I was conflating Verne's novel with other texts: movie adaptations of the novel itself, for instance, in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism--as opposed to the perils of nature itself--occurs; or hollow world stories, in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet's center. A Journey to the Center of the Earth is neither of these things, of course, and if I underwent any disillusionment, it was purely of my own making. Understood on its own terms, the novel is, at the very least, interesting, but, truthfully, not much happens. The narrator's speculations (as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place. Much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels, and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger, dehydration, or equipment loss. In fact, as best I can judge, they really don't approach anywhere near the center of the earth, although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing. The real joy is the interactions between the characters, primarily the trio of protagonists: the young narrator, his scientist uncle, and their silent, idiosyncratic guide. The expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor, whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes; his nephew, the narrator, alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings, and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them; Hans, the guide, says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner, and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once, even while under the earth (a square deal, in his eyes). Their interactions with each other, and with the variety of Icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress, are wittily and cleverly depicted. These character moments are the high point of the novel; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with Verne and how much is an invention of the translator (who, in this edition, remains sadly anonymous). Whether the novel's tone in its English version is added or simply preserved in translation, full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is. Though one reflexively considers Jules Verne a "science fiction" writer of a primitive sort, this is really more of an adventure tale and, taken as such, it is generally successful. The adventurers don't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know, but if the reader doesn't go in expecting flights of pure fancy, the novel is rather satisfying. Postscript: I should point out that this review refers to the Signet Classic mass market paperback edition of the novel, which features an afterword by Michael Dirda. Knowing Amazon, it's possible that this review will surface under several different versions, and without clarity, we have nothing.
0	I LOST CHROMOSOMES READING THIS BOOK! I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life. I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it. I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible. This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash. I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.
0	Very Out Of Date While Avalon aka Windows Presentation Framework is still in beta, I had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date. I am finding that they are dramatically out of date (writing this review 04/27/2006). This is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content; it appears to be well written. However, it was written in September 2005, and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then. About 1/2 of the examples I have tried will not even compile, or have bad runtime errors. The "big concepts" are mostly unchanged. However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. Programmer to programmer, you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new WPF tools like "Expression". This book will find you confused with broken examples fast. I look forward to an updated version when Avalon solidifies
1	SUSPENCEFULL AND TOUCHING I am currently about 2/3rds through this book. I am enjoying the book very much, but I just noticed that the very last pages including the last page of the book was ripped in half. I don't want to have to send the book back to Amazon, but would be greatful if someone has the book, would make a copy of the last 2 pages and fax to me at 404/648-8500 attn: Vicky.........Thanks! This is really a great book and I plan on ordering the 3 sequels
1	Choices This is a fascinating, entertaining, short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven. Surprisingly, they actually seem to prefer hell. This is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like. It's about people like us, and our choices, and how they affect our lives as eternal beings. Reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven, I found myself trying to keep track of who was the "right" person and who was "wrong", because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way I talk! Of course, they seemed so stupid to me because I was on the heaven side of the book. But it reminded me of a quote from the movie The Truman Show (paraphrased): "I think what bothers you is that Truman prefers his cell." These people lived in hell (and that description is interesting too) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject God in the first place. One of Lewis' easier reads, for people who find him difficult to follow
0	Fabric of Faith: A Guide to the Prayer Quilt Ministry Very disappointed in the contents of this book. I expected more information and patterns
0	The "Complete Guide" is Not Very Complete Notwithstanding the L. A. Times describing this book as easy-to-use and informative, I found it close to useless. The basic problem is that it does not give information for any individual drugs - it gives info only for drug classes. As an example, I tried to get information on using Cipro for travelers' diarrhea. I had to look up Cipro in the index, where I was referred to the fluoroquinolones section, which lists Cipro along with 12 other wide-spectrum antibotics. There is no Cipro-specific information regarding usage, dosage, or anything else. (Nor was there any mention of travelers' diarrhea.) Since the information covers 13 distinct, although related, drugs, the information is necessarily very generalized. By way of contrast, The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs 2006, which I purchased at the same time, does provide descriptions for individual drugs, and it lists travelers' diarrhea as one of the off-label uses for Cipro. The PDR Family Guide also lists individual drugs
1	One of Walters' Best THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE, in my opinion, is one of Minette Walters' best mysteries--at least one of her best I've read so far! Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed. Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception. Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters. Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth. Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had. This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations. Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction. Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery
1	The Circle Trilogy is the Best Fiction I've Ever Read Black is the first book in the Circle Trilogy and this story starts off with a bang...literaly. Thomas Hunter finds himself being shot at as the story begins and things only get better and more exciting from there. Thomas is the world's only hope, and he's also the world's only hope. On two different worlds, life as it is known will be wiped out if he can't save the world. Only he can save these two worlds, and he must save them both to survive, if he dies in one world he will die in the other. This story is intriguing as well as captivating. From the moment you pick up Black until the moment you put down White (the 3rd book) Dekker will pull you into the story while taking you on a journey that teaches you deep spiritual truths and helps you see God more clearly.
1	Excellent Book I bought this book 4 months ago because as an aspiring chef I have the need to learn as much as possible for lack of teachers in my area. I have learned how to make mayonaise, most of the basic sauces and the PATE and the crowd pleaser, Turkey Gallantine. I am thrilled to have this book amongst her other books in my collection which i refer to daily. I recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to learn from the masters (as there is not very many of them left)the art of cooking and making french and any other type of food. As for people who claim some sort of health knowledge like tereshina (which she obviously does not posses), I think she is one of those bitter people that needs to add some sugar and spice to her already depressing and pathethic life or better yet keep eating that darn styrofoam junk
1	The Best World History Atlas Book Anywhere The Oxford Atlas is the best of all competitors. It is full-size, high quality ink and paper, 368 pages and covers most areas of history from the caveman to the present time. I am not speaking of the concise edition but of the full-size edition. The ISBN number is #0195215672. This book covers about 2,000,000 years of history from the origins of humanity to the year 2000. The Atlas is the result of over three years' work by internationally renowned cartographers, an expert editorial team and specialist academic consultants
0	underwhelmed I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible. However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book. I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler. There are many much better real estate investment books out there. Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet. This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there). The book did not really touch on either of these topics. That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting. These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase
1	Absolutely Incredible Book for A Believer I can't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book, there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that, but other than that I'll have to read the other reviews. Anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which God goes to in order to bring us to Salvation, while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it's beauty and glory in careful suspension. I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger. Still I'll bet that when we get to heaven God will truthfully say, it hurt me far, far more than it hurt you. Amen.
1	The Myth of the Robber Barons Excellent book about the greatness of the entrepeneurs who didn't have to rely on gov't subsidies to succeed! Finally, a chance to hear the other side of the story. Gov't subsidies have always resulted in failure and this finally shows who the great industrialists of the 20th century were and that true laissez faire capitalism can work! Enjoy
0	horrible war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it
1	English Education majors and secondary English Teachers: check this out! This text helped me to articulate the 'principles' of Standard English by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively. Such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive, standard vs. nonstandard, formal vs. informal, grammatical vs. ungrammatical, and constitutive vs. regulative. This introductory text is written for the mature student who has had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar. Consequently, the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge. I highly recommend this text for English Education majors and secondary school English teachers.
0	Wal-Mart is a big lovely bundle of sunshine I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult. I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman. I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly
1	Excellent! Heart Warming, tear-jerker This book made me realize that there are still good people in this world. When everything seems to be going wrong and hatred between mankind seems to be the controlling factor in society, it helps to see the generosity of selfless people
1	Brilliant The Libertarian ideology and economic analysis is one of those things that is ruitinely ignored and was scorned in the 1970s and 1980s when economics was hijacked in the west by Communists. However Libertarians have offered a radical alternative that has rung true from time to time and is an important critique that deserves to have more light shed on it. This is a good beggining. A fun and interesting history that is well written and informative that explains the nature and philosophy of Libertarianism and the people behind it. Seth J. Frantzma
0	I would have to disagree with others While this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of &quot;all too common&quot; web mistakes, I have to disagree with the author's conclusions in many cases. In particular, he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible, responsible for poorly written content, lackluster site maintenance and other &quot;bloopers&quot; as he calls them. Fact is, most web developers would love to spend the time &quot;investing&quot; in doing a thorough job. However, in many cases, the client often doesn't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job. While there is enough blame to go around in poor web design, it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes. I also take exception to his commentary at times, in specific, his early mention of Enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company. He points to a bold claim Enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature. While Enron may have troubles, it's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers. We can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point. Lastly, I found the layout to be a little difficult to read. Often, the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about. The book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book. These are only a few points in a long list of what's wrong with this book. While the author makes some valid points, I found this book a little too much to stomach. Read at your own peril
1	Excellent! I absolutely loved this sequel to Something Borrowed. Just as good as the first in my opinion.
1	Great Read You can read the other reviews to see what the book is about. Fascinating stuff if you have any interest in psychedelics whatsoever. The long and short of it is that this book is a great read for being written by a doctor and medical researcher. I found it highly enjoyable. The story is as interesting as the research, and Dr. Strassman's sincere account of the project's difficulties and the personal toll it took on him made the book even more of a page-turner for me. Note that a small fraction of reviewers here did not like it. What's not to like? The book has: A brief history of psychedelics A look into governmental drug-control bureaucracy Fascinating stories of weird trips including contact with alien beings The occasional rogue test subject Pissed off Buhddists An unstable intern Hilarious slogans like: "You don't come back from .04 an atheist" And other fun stuff Highly recommended reading.
1	Simply THE best Mark Twain biography Mr. Powers leaves every other Mark Twain biographer in the dust. This work is not only beautifully detailed and researched; it is a constantly engaging 'page turner.' Beyond all that Mr. Power's own gift as a writer is extraordinary...his words literally leap from the page. One of the best reads I have had in a long time
0	NOT CONVINCING THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL
1	A tale replete with rich detail Pros: Development of setting, characters, and interweaving stories. Cons: Some might find the degree of detail too heavy and slowing. I usually start by describing some of the plot, but the story-lines are only about a third of this book's considerable charm. So . . . The Setting: This is an alternate history tale, as far as the setting goes. It takes place on Earth, and more preciously in (what is left of) England. But, this Earth had no Ice Age, it was struck by an object (popularly believed to have been a meteor) that caused the Sundering (the seas rose, the land was mostly submerged, cultures lost touch with one another, the climate changed drastically), and humans live side-by-side with mastodons, mammoths, glyptodonts, and other creatures that did not perish (because there was no Ice Age). The result is an isolated England, that retains much of its past, but has culturally evolved away from what it is (to us). The Characters: I am not sure that I have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky, interesting, amusing, well-developed characters. These are very realistic people, living in a surreal time. Even their names are colorful, quirky, and interesting: Dr. Pinches, Mrs. Matchless, Mr. Threadneedle, Tim Christmas. The characters and the writing speak strongly of a Dickensian influence, but is definitely also just plain Jeffrey Barlough's. The Plots: Yes, I did say "Plots" in the plural. There are three, distinct story-lines, that share some characters and the same setting and time period. The woes of Ms. Jane Wastefield is what I would entitle one story-line, wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment. How can she be rid of the fiendish thing?! Who can help her? Everyone wants to, but no one seems to know how. Will she succumb? Would defeat be as terrible as she fears? And what about her pet monkey? The wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about Mr. Threadneedle, his apprentice Tim Christmas, and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house. Can they make it work? Will everyone be shocked? Will anyone believe them, without seeing the finished product? Will Mr. Threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment, if he succeeds? The secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters. When rich old Joseph Cargo died, he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew, but who is Jerry Squailes, and why does he get one-fourth of the money? No one knows, and young Frederick Cargo, spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly, honest attorney, Mr. Liffey, go on a mission to uncover the truth. Will they like the truth, when and if they find it? Will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of Jerry Squailes, the unknown heir? My Take: This book is some of the best escapist reading I have ever found. The world described is so different (but not) and so replete with interesting characters, that it becomes a great place to retreat to. The writing is very detailed, with tremendous development of setting, characters, and the interweaving stories. It is truly a fascinating journey to take, and the ending(s) is not how Hollywood or fairy tales would do it, with a panoply of happily-ever-after. However, it is also not depressing. This tale is just plain well done. The Bottom Line This is a very memorable experience that takes you to a different place and tells you an interesting tale about amusing characters. Recommended: Yes
0	Unless revised, checked and almost completely rewritten, this book will remain a one star book! I bought this book because I saw it in the bargain bin at WH Smith for 99p. I hate a lot of things, I hate stamps, I hate fanboys, I even hate fanboys who collect stamps! But none of those can compare to the hatred I have for this book and my curiosity to read it! I honestly don't know where to start; there are certain FACTS which he has tried to work his way around or completely dodge. FOr instance, the videogame Killer7, he claims it has a full blown on sex scene, however I have played this and there is nothing over PG rated! He also mentions criticising the ESRB without offering any proof for what he says! The same could be said for grammar and spelling, it was completely atrocious, it is unforgivable that he is a lawyer and I believe a 16 year old could do better! What I found worse about him is the fact he gives out false threats, he threatened Rockstar Games to pull their GTA games from the shelves or he would bring a law suit to them... nothing happened! The last thing I would like to say about the book is he leaves out the negative things about him such as offering to donate $10,000 to charity if someone were to make a game of a father killing video game designers. About two or three of these games appeared on the internet and he refused to help charities. In the long run, I believe that the perception of Jack Thompson has gone bad to worse after releasing this book. A very poor and very sloppy read. Save your money, as for my copy? [...
1	For Aspiring "Bark"itects As a lifelong cat lover, I normally would not have glanced at this book, but my nephew, now a Jr. in high school, has chosen Architecture as his career. That, plus his love of dogs, caused me to have a look at the contents of this book as a possible fun gift for him. Glad I did! The imagination, the styling, the artistry, and of course, the LOVE that obviously went into the creation of this book, proved to be a great gift choice for my nephew. Even if there area no canines sharing your life, this would be a great coffee-table book to keep on display for friends and guests to enjoy
0	not worth the paper printed on We are traveling the US for almost a year and have purchased the East as well as the West edition before we started. Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows: 1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do simply not exist any more for years!! 2. The directions are awful if not wrong 3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved not to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles 4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are as wrong as they are in those 5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part of the book anymore 6. The icons in the maps are close to impossible to read (use a magnifier) Overall we can absolutely NOT recommend those books to anybody
0	Koontz was hyped as King's sole competition for so long... But I don't understand why after reading this book. I saw flashes of Koontz as a contender with this story, but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue. Koontz came up with a grand slam premise, and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line. Without that I'm not so sure I would've made it. The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete. The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid. As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN. I almost took off my running shoes at that point. Almost. Koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it. But Phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent. Pick up Intensity instead
1	Ida B Info Ida B is an excellent book. It's about a girl who lives on a farm. She talks to and names the apple trees. She is homeschooled until her mother gets cancer. Then, she is forced to go to a public school. The family has to sell some of their land to pay for Mama's treatments. Ida B has a difficult time coping with this, but thanks to her teacher she turned back to the same Ida B.
1	About Ship! Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him. What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating. I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it.
1	Great supplementary reading. The most redeeming quality of this title is its readability. Talbott is able to convey all the drama and excitment of life in international politics. That said, this certainly isn't a title which will help you get a complete understanding of India, Pakistan and nuclear weapons. I read this book to supplement required reading for a course on War in South Asia and it greatly helped in terms of reinforcing key events and players. I reccomend this to those who already have a reasonable understanding of the situation in South Asia and want a bit of light reading and would like to see the soap opera aspect of the affair.
1	Excellent Factual Overview Of The Religion Of Ancient Israel This is one book on ancient Israel that actually delivers what its title promises. In &quot;The Early History of God&quot; Mark Smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from Bronze and Iron Age Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for YHWH, his cult, and his context. Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating. The long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago, and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion. This is the kind of book that helps keep scholarship in good repute. Don't wait to read it
0	Ok I didnt really enjoy this book that much I thought it could have been bette
0	Allthough interesting story, horrible recount this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring
1	Ideal para chicos y grandes!! Esta fabúla es fácil de leer para pequeños y grandes, y con una de las mejores enseñanzas. La leí cuando tenía 8 años y ahora 20 años después sigue siendo una de mis historias favoritas. La prosa de esta historia es refrescante. El pricipito se convertirá en una persona real, que te llevará a conocer gente y lugares, pero sobre todo te enseñará una de las más importantes lecciones en la vida. Esta lectura la recomiendo a esas personas como yo que les gusta soñar y aprender. Es todo un auto-examen de personalidad. Que lo disfrute
1	Words Fail Me This is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author. The ending of this book will stay with me forever--it captures so eloquently the precious fragility of life, of relationships, of family. If you're looking for action packed melodrama, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for insight into the day-to-day details of what it is to be human, you've hit the jackpot here.
1	"A dark wind has entered his soul" "Enemies unseen... Fears unspoken...... A dark wind has entered his soul" Navajo Tribal Police Sgt. Jim Chee seems to be batting zero; so far he has not been able to solve a series of seemingly unrelated crimes. In an area that was joint use land between the Navaho and the Hopi (now Hopi) Sgt Jim Chee is given the task of finding the vandal that keeps destroying a windmill placed there to make Hopi life easer. He hears an airplane landing in the dark of night with no lights. The plane crashes and leaves a dying pilot. Also a dead man sitting up against a rock with a note in his hand saying if you want it back contact... Sgt Chee is told that it is probably drugs and federal jurisdiction. Chee is not supposed to go anywhere near or have anything to do with the case. He has his own problems with the mill, a missing thief, and a mysterious ritual death. Naturally he listens, and can not help it if they overlap. One of the reasons for reading Hillerman's books maybe more important than the overlying mystery is the descriptions of the area and the Ways of the Navaho and Hopi. Hillerman suggests you also read "The Book of the Hopi" by Frank Waters. Not as intricate as the book but still fun is the movie "Dark Wind" (Lou Diamond Phillips as Officer Jim Chee, Fred Ward as Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn
1	I love this book I love this book. I enthusiastically recommend it to everyon
1	Another fine book by the master Poirot is given a case by his old pal Spence which takes him to a small village, where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main suspect has already been arrested and sentenced... Hercule's indignities at the run down boarding house he's staying at make up the bulk of the story's humor, but the mystery is great fun, too and I doubt anyone can guess the killer, unless you're paying amazingly close attention. The characters here are some of Agatha's most entertaining, and Mrs Oliver, with her uncanny intuition, always makes a nice flighty side kick..
1	Great book Hiroshima by John Hersey is great book and I would recomend to anyone that they should read it. Hiroshima is about the dropping of the first A-bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Tells true stories of several surivors from the moment of the bombing to their years after the bombing. This book truly stands up to expectations of "Who is able to read, should read this book." I think that everyone should read this book, not only for pleasure but for the true understanding of the Atomic bombing on Hiroshima through true stories told by people still alive today
1	Loren Pope was Right!!! After a personal large university experience back in the 60's, I knew that that was not what I wanted for my children. We found Mr. Pope's book and the lights came on. Not only did we use the book, but with some diligent work were able to arrange personal counseling sessions with Mr. Pope for both my son and daughter. We live in Central Texas and my son just graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington and my daughter is now a senior at Kalamazoo College in Michigan. They both looked at quite a few schools, both recommended in the book and not: Grinnell, Reed, Colorado College, Beloit, Lawrence, Colgate, College of Wooster, Williams & Bowdoin. My son loved Whitman. It is a beautiful school in a beautiful part of America. It is not easy. He was challenged. There is a great respect between the college and the town of 30,000. (To parents: Walla Walla is a great place to visit. There are 50+ wonderful wine tasting rooms in the immediate area.) My daugher also is happy with her choice at Kzoo. The winters are cold for a Texas girl, but the personal attention that so many of the professors have given to her and her friends is amazing. The K Study Abroad Program which is 65 years old and rated among the best in the nation for all colleges was fabulous for her. She spent six months in Ecuador and loved it. Our nephew, also from Texas, will be leaving for six months in Thailand in another good program. Loren was right. These schools do provide personal attention and are there to make sure their students succeed
0	Not the best book This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system. This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times. I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe. But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends. This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting. The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much. The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times. As a result, the book became a little boring. I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across. About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review. The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers. Secondly, I did not like the book. Plain and simple. That is OK. Not every book jives with everybody. I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring. I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus. You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you. I am free to express my opinions on these books. And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life. You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me. So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers. I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it. I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other
0	700+ pages of reader suffering This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself. It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature. So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second.
0	Complete And Utter Garbage Nancy helps Mr. Drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building. The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck. Ooooooh! That's so scary. Yawwwwwwn. This book is absolutely horrible. The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery. It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals. When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people. Lots of suspense there. This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants. This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating
1	One-Eyed Cat One-Eyed Cat written by Paula Fox is a sweet book about a boy whose mom is in wheelchair and dad is minister at the church. Ned the boy receives a share of trouble throughout the book. I enjoyed this book because it is interesting within the book about Rivers, and animals. I disliked the book because it started out so slow in the beginning and rest of the book. I also disliked the book because the characters are dull and there isn't much rising action and major conflict so it is not as exciting as other books. I also liked it because of it's setting of different places by the Hudson River. This is a good book, I suggest reading it. Good reading for all ages. Dylan P. Creston, California
0	Lame detective The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all. The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case. How does she resolve her dilemma? By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity. Lame! And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere. I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out
0	In Country In Country, how can I describe this book? In four words crappy piece of garbage; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school, and i've got too say, to give it two thumbs up you'll have to read it 8 times. I agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1, but Tom,Sam, and Lonnies life story just isn't interesting. Look at their names, there too basic. Too tell you the truth Kentucky is boring, the books boring, and the author is boring. You have to drink coffee to read this book; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book. My advise to all you readers is to jack the book from Barnes and Noble,Borders or photo copy it, save the money for the coffee because your gonna need it
1	Keys to Drawing and Seeing This book tells us the importance of seeing rather than drawing. In most cases the how-to book tells only about the methods, but such methods will not keep overnight. But the author of this book knows the real nature of drawing, so he advises us to draw without watching. This is the wonderful book
0	save your money: poor translations/newsprint-like book You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable. Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper. This does not do justice to the tales
0	Needs Editing This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well. Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng. Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention
0	bad book I was very disapointed. The Reason manuel is 10 times better. I went back reading Reason 2.5 power by Michael Prager.Gonna buy his version of 3.0.Should have done it in the first place
0	A bit thin on... Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers
1	A Must-Have for Anyone into Landscape Ecology or GIS If the credentials of the authors didn't convince of the quality of this book, I'm not sure I can. I will say that I have read and re-read the book several times, and that it's a vital resource in our laboratory. From the various issues of scaling to what analyses do what, this book is an excellent resource of theories and technologies involved in Landscape Ecology
0	Unsuitable for undergraduates The original Mechanical Engineering Design book written by Joseph Shigley, and later, with Larry Mitchell, was an excellent undergraduate text; it was readable at the introductory level, and it contained enough information and methodology for use as a good reference book after graduation. Unfortunately, this revised text, which was rewritten by Charles Mischke, is thoroughly unreadable, obfuscating, and is totally unsuitable as a text for undergraduate mechanical engineering students. The book is full of nuances, subtleties and informative data that do make it useful as a reference book on the shelf of an experienced design engineer, but not as a text for students learning the subject. For those who plan to teach a course for mechanical engineering majors on this topic, I recommend other texts such a Jack Collins' Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines, Wiley, 2003
1	An Engineer's View This book was chosen as one of the books to be read and discussed by my men's book club. The author's treatment of the creation is absolutely spell binding and very convincing to an engineer. The way in which the author finds God's face in so many things is interesting and absorbing. I had trouble putting it down, it reads so easily
0	Disappointment! This book starts out telling of the sack of Rome and grabbing the reader's attention. It's all down hill from there. The next third of the book is a long drawn out build up with very little of the book actually dedicated to the finale of the build up. The there is this a bit of drawn out rambling that leads into a sudden ending of the book. It was almost as if the writer either got tired of writing and gave up, or she just didn't know how to end it, so she just ended it. I was highly disappointed.
1	Good Basic Guide to Cruising I bought the book to begin CLIA training. This book is very basic, but covers many different aspects of the cruise industry. If you are beginning to work in cruise sales, or are just interested in cruising, I would definitely recommend it.
1	Love it This book is such a blessing to me. I'm only up to day 8 (their are 100 days worth of devotions and prayers) and I haven't over-eaten once. God is using this book to bless me. Please buy it, read it, and let God use it in your life. Giving God your eating habits and your size will be the best thing you can do for yourself. This book IS worth getting. Please buy it and find out for yourself how much it can help you. It's helping me. It's more than helping me, it's giving me victory
0	It would be funny if it weren't so sad Probably the most (although certainly not the only) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on Caroline Higgins, a professor at Earlham College. Horowitz objects to Higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the Peace and Global Studies program, at a Quaker college. It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value. That Horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection, and one involving such a tiny private college, shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to 101
0	NO sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined
0	Style of writing is painful Just start reading the introduction, or flip to anywhere in this book to see all you need to know about it's readability: a bit rough to say the least. For example, in the introduction, the concept of carrying binary data in a shorter period of time on a wire than several measured pulses was presented in such a confusing manner that I was forced to read it 4 times to understand what was already a simple and understood concept to me. The excessive formality of this book is a killer.. It reads at times like a formal mathematics proof book, however, at other times it is a bit more readable. Like people said.. use this for reference.. not for a textbook
0	shallow self-indulgence I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me
0	The Globalization of Guilt 1. The persective of most writers is shaped by their own experience. Dr.Steele is an American Black, a baby boomer, a member of the academic elite, a liberal arts major, and a political "conservative".This certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues. 2. I felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated America and during the civil rights movement. His take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of Civil Rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain "moral authority" by doing GOOD....and the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts... helps explain some of the dysfunctional after- effects that are still with us. 3. Where I disagree with his analysis - speaking from my own experience and perspective of course - is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the US and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years! And he blames the "dissociating liberals" (whoever they are) for attempting to deal with these social issues. Excuse me, but I recall Nixon and the Reaganites being in power for awhile and the Bush dynasty is still with us and I haven't seen a lot of effort being done to get-together and fix things for average folks here in the good ole US of A. Of course pressing the GUILT button in this mainly Judeo-Christian culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention. 4. My point is that by injecting blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even further.His statement about Red and Blue States was a hoot! How is this helpful? Where are his suggestions for improvement - other than that he thinks Bush & Co. now have the "moral authority" that has been so lacking in America? Some might be inclined to disagree. 5. Finally, as a black Dr. Steele misreads me as a white liberal in that I have never felt guilty about my white heritage - only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans - themselves victims of misbegotten religious dogma.If we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process.........and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past,we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer space.Not a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative.
1	A gem of a stone Lincoln Rhyme, detective extraordinaire and forensics expert, is hot on the trail of a chinese human smuggler/terrorist nicknamed The Ghost. A couple of the illegal immigrants being shipped to the US have escaped, are in hiding, and are being hunted down by The Ghost. The combined forces of the NYPD, FBI, as well as the INS must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out. Jeffery Deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Sonny Li, an undercover cop from China, is the most outstanding character in the book. Since most detective thrillers are generic, it's good to come across splendid work like this. Lincoln Rhyme fans obviously will enjoy The Stone Monkey, but initiates will also be thrilled by it
1	A very good book but you will need others This is my 3rd book on real estate investing and I must say that each is totally different, with different ideas and different strategies. I think it's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know. I like how she talks about goal setting, something I've learned from Tony Robbins and that I feel is really important. I like how she calculates the rate of return. I like her differing point of views. I would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book. Overall I learned a lot, despite having already read 2 other good books. A few things I didn't like: I would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties. And especially calculating if I can afford it or not. The information she gives is quite good, but since this is the most important topic I think it deserved even more. The book is well worth the price and if you're serious about investing I highly recommend it.
1	Very Interestingly Confusing This book (the cover amazon has displayed is *wrong*) is very interesting. It is also exceedingly strange. It was never boring, but it never made too much sense either. You think there might be supernatural elements involved -- but maybe not. It's a tale of the coming to America from England, the stuff that happens to the British here, and Indians. Cool, confusing, book
0	The one book I was told to read and actually did...... And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring.... Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies. The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty. I have read other "Classics" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this.
1	Short, Simple & Sweet Yet Power Packed with Life Changing Principles I had heard of this book through someone else and wanted to read it because of the self-help quiz at the book's website. However, when I got the chance to read it, I finished it almost in one sitting. Like one of the other reviewers said, it reminds you of the basics and how the act of being nice to someone no matter what their station is in life can ultimately change your life. What I like is that the book doesn't teach you to fake being nice; it challenges you to actually be genuinely nice to others, often with no thought of gaining something in return. A simple principle but as its many examples illustrate, a powerful one that can impact your life in ways you'd never expect.
1	Delightful! Karen O'Connor's new book is a gem. I found myself laughing out loud, nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family. I've always enjoyed Ms. O'Connor's other books, but this is the best yet. It's also a book to share. Buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents &quot;just because.&quot; That's what I'm going to do
0	A hacked version of the classic anthology As a huge fan of the author and the original release of this brilliant short story collection, I am extremely disappointed in the new release. HUNT DOWN THE ORIGINAL. The new version omits all of Zelazny's forewords and, more damning, it actually omits some of the better stories found in the original collection. Silverburg mentions &quot;Horsemen!&quot; in the introduction, then the story is strangely absent. This is a travesty
0	not worth the money A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.
1	Everybody is Beautiful Each character is perfect. The women are so loving and the men so caring that they pair up nicely in four sweltering short stories. They live in a fantasy world full of friendship, kindness, and romance. Life is wonderful; no major worries except whether they like and love each other but those never last long. Everybody earns some sort of good income. Everything comes to a faultless ending. Each story involves hot chocolate suitable to the title of the collection. It is a great read before going to bed
1	Unconceivable story, but an amazing piece of literary work! The Partner has quite an outrageous story line, but the way in which Grisham tells the story is absolutely amazing: starting with the climax, Grisham leaves the reader confused and uncertain on his or her feelings for certain characters; as he works backwards telling the story leading up to the climax through events in the present, all the pieces fall into place and the confusing events and feelings in the beginning now make perfect sense. Yet another great novel from John Grisham
1	Is It Reality Or A Blend Of Reality And Fantasy? I read this book thirty years ago(do you think I waited long enough to write this review?) and enjoyed it very much, but found it perplexing. I, myself, am a yogi, but this story would strike most people as being a blend of truth and fantasy. But what is wrong with that? It is a beautiful story that teaches us many things about the way yogis look at life--and death. Do not approach this book with a critical eye on truth. Instead, think of it as a type of epic poem. Reflect on the reality of it at your leasure! One thing is true about this book: the author wrote this book with great love of all humanity! If you have developed an interest in some aspect of yoga and want to learn something more of what traditional yoga(as opposed to the "designer" versions touted lately) is about, give this a try
1	U.S. Constitution hippocket book The book arrived in good condition, and is indeed a hip-pocket sized book
0	The "Waiting for Godot" of Novels The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman. He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it. This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong. Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him. While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading. In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears. While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct. The title, too, is misleading. "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies. While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie. Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward. If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead. And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times. But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.
0	Disappointment... I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above. The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food. If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few
1	A different outlook on life! A confession of an Economic Hit Man was excellent book on the United States government raises to global dominate via corporation American and private organization. The push for global dominate has been forced upon Americans through education, and media outlets.
0	Not his best work As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade. I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his collection of Buechner family memoribilia. As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work. And it reads like a review of one's summer family reunion. Sorry. Read his other stuff. It's great!
1	Riveting excursion into small town relationships. Salem's Lot has become a yearly staple for me. When the days begin to grow short, and the air gets a little thick and crisp, I like to pull this book out, and go for a lie in the hammock. It has been a fall favorite, since my freshman year of college. Though not entirely wholesome, this book is one of the most puritan of Stephen King's prolific library. There are really no graphic sexual scenes, and the language is tame, in comparison to . . . say, The Stand. But you don't care about that. You want to know why I thought it was a heck of a good read. King is fascinated by small towns. I can say that with a good deal of authority, because two-thirds of what he writes about takes place in small, Maine towns. It's not the four-way intersections, and the cowpoke attitude that seems to capture his interest, but the dynamics of the small town, itself. There is a certain attitude, in a small town; kind of like high school cliques, but on a grander scheme. A small town has its own atmosphere; its own incestuous existence. Stephen King enjoys watching as relationships frazzle, and small towns are demolished, with the ghoulish glee of a small child knocking over sandcastles. 'Salem's Lot mixes stark dread with a Rockwellian nostalgia that oozes out of the pages. The result is a horrifically delicious milkshake that covers some traditional vampire ground, but also manages to stay fresh and poignant. If the cemetery scene (in which a father grieves for his dead son) doesn't give you goosebumps, you are truly a jaded individual.
0	Ammie, Go Away! This book is so bad I don't even know where to start. I bought it based on many of the reviews on this page, and since I had previously read The Master Of Blacktower and loved it, I thought that this book would be similarly good. I was terribly wrong! Right away the dialogue ticked me off because real people don't talk the way that the characters talk in this book. The dialogue (mainly involving MacDougal and Bruce) is filled with pompous remarks and ridiculous attempts to sound intelligent. It is so forced that it makes you want to cringe (when they start arguing about Christian theory and the Middle Ages while Sara is passed out on the floor from demonic possession, you know that you should just stop reading now). It is like in one of those bad TV movies where, when something terrible happens, all of the characters stand around and say "I wonder what we'll do?" I cannot believe how bad this is. The possession/seance thing is completely hokey anyway. Don't waste your time with this one. I couldn't even finish it.
0	Emotions, Soul, and Heart Combine to Make a Person Whole. This is a continuation of The Mind of The Soul by this pair and The Seat of the Soul by Mr. Zukav. He has published three others about the soul, yet he is not a psychologist or specialist in this field. This is an extremely simplified textbook which found its way to the library sale. The bold-faced "highlighted" parts throughout are distracting. From some of the diagams, these ideas: "The early antidote for painful emotions is Love and Trust" (combined), "You continually encounter what your soul wants you to encounter. When you resist your encounters, you resist the purpose of your life, the beneficience of the Universe, non-physical assistance. That resistance is your pain," and "Stress is your indication you are resisting your experience in the present moment. When you resist your emotions, you create stress." Your emotions are the force field of your soul. Each emotion is a message for you, a signal from your soul. When you are aware of everything you are feeling all the time (emotional awareness), you are in continual communication with your soul. This book is a lot of wishful thinking. They are a good-looking couple, but hardly qualified to influence educated persons about how to handle emotions or reach deep down to find one's soul. That is a spiritual thing
1	Fascinating I hightly recommend this book. An easy, quick read that could change your life
0	John Ayres is no Delphi expert and certainly no writer You'd think the qualifications for writing a Delphi book would be 1) you must be a Delphi expert 2) you must write well. Well, I can tell you for sure that this guy doesn't meet either qualification. This is, without question, the worst programming book I have ever had the misfortune to buy. Ayres writes like a third grader. And the code is even worse. A person who'd never seen Delphi before could write this code. It is mostly warmed over MSDN example code converted to Pascal. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to publish something like this. It's that bad
1	Erotica Through the Ages. This book is a fine representation of erotica through the ages with examples from portfolios of great photographers. This is a great anthology of primitive to the modern world of glamour/erotic photography
0	Didn't care for the book... Didn't care for the book. I don't think it's easy to follow or well organized
1	So You Wanna Start a Revolution? Common Sense is a must read for all citizens of the USA and world seeking liberation from long established regimes. In this short, but well written published pre-revolutionary work, Paine makes the argument for a complete separation from England. In a time when many were not sure separation was the correct option, Thomas Paine spells out 100 % revolution in clear English that provided the spark for the Declaration of Independence. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and there would be no turning back. A true piece of fine USA history
1	Got me my MOS Master! 1 Play and learn all the functions of the 2003 applications. 2 Use MeasureUp practice tests; you can play with all the functions in 2003 using the online version of the MeasureUp practice test if you don't have a copy of the all the 2003 applications. 3 Use the Certiport practice tests, the 2002 versions are just as helpful and seem to be free, so much overlaps. 4 Use this book; I never much used the printed copy, I used the Adobe pdf version that came along with it along with the practice files
1	Gripping story of survival London is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. His writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors. The story he tells is stark and real, and as such, it is not pretty picture he paints, nor an elevating story he writes. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes. Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives. Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed
0	The Bottom Line: the 3BL Fad Promises More than it Delivers Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well. It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking? At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet. There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money. There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business. Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that. Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new
1	Awesome book I bought this for my daughter who wants to go into forensics & she said she can't put it down!!! She really likes it & it gets into the very things she wants to study about
0	Count me in the minority Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book. The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance. There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity. The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores. Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket. Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs. Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness. The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else. The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent. Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style. It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced. I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype.
1	Definitive...a wonderful addition to my library I purchased this book when it first came out. I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time, and have used it as a reference ever since. What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance. So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed. No other work like it had been available. And what a revelation about many of them. Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it. Really needed and really wonderful work
1	Must Read for Modern German History Majors! I was led to reading this book for a paper I did on the civil rights of women and reasons behind women's support of the state during Hitler's reign. Professor Koonz did a superb job of bring several elements together to form a large, descriptive view of the lives of all women, Christian, Jewish, Nazi, Socialist, etc. I found the interview done with Frau Scholtz-Klink, former head of the women's department under the Nazis, one of the most fascinating, especially since she has held on to her Nazism when other Germans such as Hemult Kohl have renounced and apologized for their role in Nazi Germany. For the first time in all my studies of Germany, I finally began to understand not only who, what and when but also how and why the German Weimar Republic of the 1920's could accept a dictator such as Hitler
0	Not happy I ordered this book twice, especially because the picture shows the book with a blue cover which is the Cambridge Press edition.The books I received were not from Canbridge Press and did not have the Appendix III which is the genealogy. These books came from paperbackshop in England. I feel that the genealogy is a very important part of this book and should always be included.
0	Good only for 007 fans. You will find the Ornithologist James Bond's old employer, Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences does not sell copies of this book. They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead. Why? Because, it is at least from the 1930. it contains information which is seriously dated. Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates. The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter. This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird. Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday? Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots). You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers. That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers. The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel. Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's "Birds of the West Indies", which Fleming described as his bible. Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility). Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using the name James Bond in his novels. Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's "Caribbean Birds". You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of "Birds of the West Indies" was the only show in town. In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book. Consider this review with that in mind
1	Should be required for all law students I am a law student who read this edition of Blackstone's Commentaries for a jurisprudence course, and it was a great experience. Blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among Greek, Roman, and civil law. He also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights, property, civil procedure, and criminal law in England. These sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law. In addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of England's government at the time just before our nation's independence and why it had been superior, at that time, to any other form of government in all of Europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty. I highly recommend at least volume I to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government. His explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how English government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from England. Any scholar, student, or avid reader of political science, law, or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work. Ignore the earlier critique of the font, the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate. The only real difference is "f" is used in place of "s" everywhere but in the last letter of words ("greateft" "fortrefs" "fubject" etc.). Generally it's very clear when the "f" is an "s" although there are a few confusing exceptions (e.g. "wife" is "wise" as in the "wife laws of England..."). The first edition included footnotes where Blackstone cited English, Latin, and Roman works and these are reproduced here as well.
0	Lost $10 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?
1	*Those Mesmerizing Eyes & A Special Easter Egg* How could I have missed HUNWICK until now? He is a rabbit-eared Bandicoot, one of an endangered species, familiarly known in Australia as the BILBY. *Aussie* reviewer "LIN" won me over by suggesting that "Hunwick's Egg" would be a great Easter gift. Hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch. They are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug: a cockatoo, an echidna (resembling a porcupine), and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *Bryll Cream* . . . Hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen! But still the egg does not hatch. The plant life is gorgeous, drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils. I am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus, and other green wildflowers. After referring to my dictionary I felt tricked into falling for a RAT, of all things. I don't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature! The more important reality is that HAPPINESS CAN ERUPT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF RELATIONSHIPS. It is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow. Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends that you make sure you have an Easter Basket large enough to accommodate this precious book
0	Not as good as &quot;Women on Top&quot; While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them. Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates. If you're looking for this type of book, I strongly recommend &quot;Women on Top&quot;
0	Very disappointing I hate this book. All the book is the repetition of the same code with very, very few differences. The description lets argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that is hard to believe. It uses SOAP in it's more basic fashion. The code is poor (also the HTML and the Javascript used). The code is written in a so invesive fashion that if you strip it (and is not a bad idea), you will find no more than 30 pages. The Multi-Tier is just supposed to be good and misuesed. As you may understand, I strongly advise to not buy this book
0	How I spent my vacation There are two ways I can describe this book: as an assigned essay on &quot;How I Spent My Vacation,&quot; in which it might receive a passing grade in High School; or as a visit by your brother-in-law, the one you never really liked but tolerated for your sister's sake, who shares his superficial ideas as if they were deep insights. I suppose there are people who will voluntarily submit to either, but I'm not one of them. The author (he can only be called a writer in the most literal sense) has no insight to speak of, is manifestly incompetent at background research, and lacks any useful power of description. He really should look up the meanings of words like &quot;masquerade&quot; and &quot;circumvent&quot; before he uses them. . . The real mystery is how something like this ever gets published
0	Disappointed I was excited to get this book, since I am a stay-at-home mother of three. I believe that it's important to take care of yourself and feel confident in your decision to be a mother. This book didn't really give much advice. It skimmed the surface with suggestions about dressing cute, exercising, taking time for yourself...things I've heard a thousand times before. I like to hear real life tips on how other mom's do these things and more. I thought the book was a rip-off with no real content. A much better book, if you stay at home with your kids is Happy Housewives by Darla Shine.
1	Detailed transformations of algorithms for optimal desighns This is an excellent book, written by one of the authorities in the field. It offers detailed design techniques that will help the system designer explore the 3-dimension design space and achieve optimizations in all or either of: area, time, energy consumption. The use of specific examples illustrates the techniques, while complicated backround information is well-organized in the Appendices. I used the book as a recommended text book in my 1-semester "VLSI Signal Processing" graduate-level class and the students really loved it. It covers all availble techniques, from the simplest to the most advanced ones, with full explanation of the theory, with complete and detailed implementation steps for a wide range of signal processing algorithms.Since the book does not deal with the design at the physical level, but with transformations of the processing algorithms so that their VLSI implementations will satisfy certain criteria of optimality, it is not absolutely mandatory that the reader has already taken courses in VLSI design, although this could help appreciate the benefits offered by the techniques detailed in the book. The exercises found at the end of each chapter help the reader apply the learned techniques in all kinds of applications. I am convinced that the thoroughness and the high standards accomplished by the author in the writing of this book will help establish it as the leading text or reference book for several years to come
1	A valid and persuasive discussion Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern. It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty. By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, "It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions." (P.26) From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of "unmaking". It can be characterized as a rejection of all "metanarratives" or "grandnarratives"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the `canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical "anti" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: "...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation." (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991) In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times "cult-like" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a "grand-narrative" to keep us chained. For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation. He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well. This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory.
0	Overrated book by overrated Genius This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius.
1	Great Help for Frazzled Teachers! This book has many useful,practical ideas for effectively using literacy workstations. My school year has started so smoothly because of the things I learned from this book. I highly recommend it to anyone new to workstations, and even to veteran teachers for a fresh perspective
1	A well researched overview of life in the early colonies. This book is a well researched and organized overview of life in the early American colonies. Taylor goes to great pains to supply insights into government and family matters of, and the trades and professions of 17th and 18th century settlers. Intended as a sourcebook for writers, it is also a must for the history student who wishes to better understand American colonists
0	Do not buy this book Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book. Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books. There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way. The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members. I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't. I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review. I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH
1	Interesting outlook on what angels do for ordinary folks. This author always has a unique look at religious views. Practical applications and a lot of stories illustrating what the angels have done for folks. No scientifc proof but the author freely and upfront says so. I like this author and have had positive experiences using some of her instructions. If for no other reason her ideas do no harm and are very good for stress and the everyday worries we all have. I enjoy her books and you can read in one gulp or piecemeal and still come away with a different perspective than you started
1	Stop Searching. Begin here I am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one. (Talking about computer books ofcourse!). This is especially significant when it comes to XML because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away. This book does exactly that. You will start writing decent xml right away. The following will be helpful. 1. HTML knowledge (a little) 2. The concept of scripts 3. The concept of CSS 4. The concept of XML When I say 'the concept of', I am only talking about a surface level, "Purpose of existence" kind. Even if you don't know anything about XML, you will be fine with this book. The book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas. Peace.
0	A Better Movie then a Book I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.
1	....hmmm....what a great book! I love this book! Early teens and older should read this book. Learn what it means to love and to sacrifice.
0	Get Asad it is by far a better text The only reason Pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in nations such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia and parts of Africa. Firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the Quran in a coherent fashion. People "claim" that he is very much true to the Arabic of the Quran; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context. Well that is the point how can it be a "literal" translation when it is infact out of context in most places. There is also an issue of a history with this translation, it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator (Pickthall) but other individuals. Most Quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error. That is the problem, most readers who rely on the English (first hand) may not even know if there are errors. Not only is this translation subjective, nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the Quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is NOT substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he; (or now in the case of so many revisions, as "they") did.
0	Unbelievable I have read every one of Stephen King's books. This was the only one that I have not read. I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one. The style of Peter Straub stinks. Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about. Stephen King has finally written a real clunker. This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read
1	Satisfying read A very romantic story. Somewhat graphic with quite of bit of swearing but in a low-key way. I read it and then read it again a few days later. Too long to read in one sitting. It made me cry
0	I'm Trying To Think of Something Good To Say I can't find anything good to say about this book. I agree that it's tedious, boring and a waste of money. I put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why', closed it up and put it up. I was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it. It's not even worth the $.01.
0	Not useful Although the work depicted in the photos is incredible, none of it is very useful. Nice to look at - not at all practical for everyday painters
0	Good idea didn't translate into a book I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book: 1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point. 2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story. 3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting... i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette
0	Who believes this? This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this. The reason for this one star rating is this. First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING! Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent. Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things. Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some. Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton.
0	Why was this book written? I finally found the book that should never have been written. The book was given to me, so I tried to read it. Why would anyone waste their time comparing Tom Clancy's novel hero against real life presidents and presidental polices? I have concluded that the author must be jealous of Clancy's success and thought he could make a little money writing a book comparing a fictitious character virsus real presidental policy. This book really deserved a minus star
