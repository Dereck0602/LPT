1	The greatest country Christmas album! The best country music Christmas CD I have ever heard. I have always been a fan of Randy Travis. During Christmas, this CD is continously being played on my stereo. I would recommend this album to anybody who likes Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans
1	The best Supertramp live album even 25 years later Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980. The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes a more important live document of the band, indeed. Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century(the spirited opener School, Bloody Well Right, Hide in Your Shell, Asylum, Dreamer, Rudy and the closing Crime of the Century which closes this live album), three songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (Ain't Nobody But Me, A Soapbox Opera and Two of Us), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments(From Now On and Fool's Overture), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America(the monster hit The Logical Song, the title cut and the Top 20 smash Take The Long Way Home) plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis? What Crisis?. Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/vocalist Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards, additional backing vocals and band MC(he does the stage bantering here, especially his humorous intro to Breakfast in America), drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is played at a faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section. Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts(going Gold right away) and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album. Highly recommended!
1	This album is amazing This is the greatest piece of music I have ever heard. Out of my 300 cds, I listen to it the most. It is great to work out to, to drive to, to do anything to. I've been listening to it for 12 years and still find sneaky little percussion nuances that I didn't realize were there. Everything else by Talking Heads and byrne solo, while still brilliant, is not on the same plane. Hilarious lyrics, irresistable grooves, totally original songwriting, white hot rhythm, a masterpiece. When was the last time a song made you feel angst ridden and ecstatic at the same time? "Something ain't right" does.
0	Gunners worst "album" Back in 1993 I was a kid that really loved Guns N' Roses. They were the best rock band in the world, so I decided to blindly buy this album, and to my surprise....it sucked big time. I don't like Guns N' Roses much now because I now understand their sometimes stupid and racists lyrics. However, this album compared to Appetite, lies and U.Y.I. 1 and 2 deserves a -5 stars. If this album would have been recorded by any other band it would sucked too and it would not have sold more than 2000 or 3000 copies. My advice, if you like GNR you will find that all their previous albums are just wonderful, but please, don't buy this crap. The cover image says it all it looks like a s... and 99% of this album songs are s...
0	Uh, yeah.... Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me. A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying. Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad. I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to. But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible. They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer. Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times
0	I H8 EAZY ( dre is cooler ) I can't believe people like Eazy-E more than Dr.Dre. Dre is way better than sleazy-e. Stay with Dre, not sleazy-e
0	Gave it a few listens but.... Like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments, the singer's voice, the melodies
0	Rivers run dry Don't buy it. If you can get Carpet Man on another collection, do so. He's better off not trying to be hip because he is not. I purchased this for historical purposes, but if you ever wonder about pop idols trying to be hip, Tommy Roe did a little better with Winter's Day
1	Amazing What an amazing DVD, not only the music is great the visual effects are extraordinary. A definite must buy
1	John Mayer: New to me. Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later. John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me.
0	This single cost Britney's knee! There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing. Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.
1	Musically Flawless So how about that? A Mahler second that actually moves! The result is one of the most exciting readings of all time. It's truly legend. This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording. Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe.. Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual. Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural. The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant. This is some masterpiece material. A truly excellent CD
1	A Mandatory Slice of American Pie All children, especially American children, should be introduced to the first two Boston albums at an early age. They are among the best guitar oriented rock records ever in the history of humankind. Fantastic guitar arrangements and tone, and otherwordly vocals performances by Brad Delp all captured here for our enjoyment in perpetuity. You owe Tom Scholtz more money, and you know it
1	Best Rap Group There Will EVER Be This is undoubtably the Beasties' best CD. There still great now, but on here they're more Rap/Rock, which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop, which isn't a bad thing. Most rap nowadays really sucks goats(*cough*cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall *cough*cough). This great disc features such classics as Girls, No Sleep Til' Brooklyn(the Beasties best song), Rymin and Stealin(which has a rather nice tribute to The Clash), Fight For Your Right, Hold it Now Hit It, And the infamous Brass Monkey. If you're a fan of any rap or rock, I highly reccomend this amazing CD
0	it Was a big let down. A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo
1	Excellent Heavy Album DevilDriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album "The Fury of our Maker's Hand". This CD is excellent. The guitar riffs are amazing, and Dez Fafara is definitely unique with his vocals. The tracks vary in speed, whether it's the up-tempo of "Hold Back The Day" or "Driving Down the Darkness", or the doomy "Sin and Sacrifice". "Grinf**ked" is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem. Recommended if you like it heavy. P.S. This isn't "brutal death metal". Brutal death metal is stuff like Devourment, Saprogenic, Gorgasm, etc. Just so that you know.
1	I'm thinking this is THE BEST As much as I loved this album there IS one thing better. That is watching The Chieftains and Mr Nunez perform live. What a wonderful experience both are!
0	THE DVD IS BAD, AS IN NOT WORTH WATCHING !!!!! I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S.....................
1	A Dark Masterpiece! "Berlin", which was Reed's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album "Transformer", showcases a radical change in Reed's direction. Whereas "Transformer" was a mostty light and musically catchy album, "Berlin" is a more complex and darker album; both musically and lyrically. No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on "Transformer", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for "Best of" compilations. Songs like "Caroline Says" and "How Do Think it Feels" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation. The "Berlin" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially "Lady Day" ( Kurt Weil ). The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks. This is Reed's Dark Masterpiece
1	One of his best I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best. Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers
1	ELEGANTLY COOL!!! This cd is as cool as they come. Simply smooth all the way through. I love every song here. If you are thinking about getting this cd, stop and go get it. You'll love it. Ta ta..
0	No fun! I can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke CD! This is just a regular music CD with the lyrics inside the package. The lyrics do NOT show up on the TV screen when put into the karaoke machine. No fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another, under good light because the type is so small!!!! Oh yeah, great fun for a 6 year old.....NOT!!
1	Revs This is an excellent CD! I honestly can't listen to the CD enough. I've had friends listen to the CD who aren't even interested in any sort of Celtic or instrumental music and they also raved over it. McGoldrick needs to put out another one
1	Still great after 15 years of listening My mom bought this years ago and I still think it's wonderful music for Christmas. Definitely buy this album.
1	The higher you go! Energy=Hot Hot Heat! this album is full of it, though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments. With catchy melodies thougout the album, though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says, you'll be sure to enjoy this alternative' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance, Dance!!, that is all Hot Hot Heat makes you want to dance, besides that, they also have other songs like "elevator" and "jingle jangle" to tone down the album. This whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member, but newly found one, being a great addition, and being in love. So to dance and sing get this album.
1	Best soul in ages. This album blew me away from the moment I heard it. The only downside is there are not many songs with vocals on the album. If you like old funk or soul then this album is for you. These guys will leave footprints in the history books of this genre
1	Contemplative Goldbergs Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the "Goldberg Variations," but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental. Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant "Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner" (BWV989). Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig. With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label. And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series. Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style. She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music. Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording. Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines. Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity. Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance. Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions. In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights. Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful. But, in the famous 25th "Black Pearl" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march. Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference. Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit. But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity. But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal. I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night. Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar "sweetness" of style as Hewitt. As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality). Many others have also given great performances. Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings. ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations). I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others. But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations. The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like. All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion
1	The Jacksons: Re-Invented, or Re-Controlled? In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened "Jacksons" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few. They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, "The Jacksons" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with "Enjoy Yourself" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic "Style Of Life". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that "Good Times" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat
0	Hate to admit it Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good. Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing. This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together. The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself. Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'
0	Rosemary Clooney missing ... arrangements not the usual! If you're a fan of either "Holiday Inn" or "White Christmas" you really, really should avoid this one. Its recording quality not only offers substandard "tin can" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas. This is not a soundtrack. It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen. Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films. The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... "hate" doesn't fit. I am, however, not keeping this CD. Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear. If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either. Good luck in finding the real thing!
0	This CD could have been way better! This CD Sucks. I mean Bruce Springstein is such a has been. Dude retire please! U2 also another has been group. I think someone needs to revamp the Grammy nominations and choose some really great music. Ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old!!
1	Fantastic musicians, wonderful music Doc Watson is great, and so is Clarence Ashley. This is music worth listening to. Often
0	Much better that anything Tool ever did Yeah, man. I used to be like really stupid. I got bad grades in school. But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, "whoa!" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market "Lonesome Crowded West" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club? This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I "get" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, "My thoughts weren't so loud" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to "This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like "The Moon and Antarctica" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who "gets Modest Mouse" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like "Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart," you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing. j5w2k9@hotmail.com
0	Weak Orchestral Arrangements + Not Ottmar's Best I am a fan of Ottmar's work so I did not hesitate when I found a copy of this album for sale. Though not a terrible record it is not what your average Ottmar fan has come to expect. The orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst. Ottmar's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements. None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice. There are FAR better choices for anyone who likes Ottmar's work. Stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else (as I will be doing)
1	I love you Danielle, love Garry You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr
1	This is OK-Vol. 2 is better This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map
0	Live Beautiful Day Couple good renditions but pretty poor sonics and a number of forgettable tunes. Their studio album "It's a Beautiful Day" remains the one to own
1	Wailers sophomore album This 1973 follow up to the Wailers debut `Catch A Fire' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the Jamaican underground scene for years. `Get Up, Stand Up' and `I Shot The Sheriff' are two of the most hitting cuts the Wailers ever recorded, but the rest of the material doesn't have the same mass appeal of their other albums. This is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience. It's a cool set but `Burnin' isn't an album I can bump too much
1	Gently Overwhelming Time Without Consequence is one of those albums. One of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music. The quiet, gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding. Murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music. It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well. The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction. I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album. All the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over. This will probably be the top album of the year for me, and it is definitely the best I've heard so far. Great music.
0	Human Stink buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve
1	A man of many colors Jack White has done it again! This is my second White Stripes CD (first being Elephant) and it does not disappoint. Jack White still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals. This album seems more mature in a way but at the same time, you know it's the White Stripes from the opening riff and when Jack's vocals come in. Red Rain, White Moon, and Blue Orchid shows that Jack White loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles. My favorites, though, are Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet). I think I still like Elephant better but one thing is for certain - the White Stripes aren't fading away anytime soon. I love his Led Zeppelin/Nirvana style voice and can't wait to hear his new band, The Raconteurs
1	The GREATEST soundtrack of all time! This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the "Titanic" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: "National Treasure Suite" (Track 1). The Tracks: "Library of Congress" (Track 4), and "Declaration of Independence" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: "Spectacle Discovery" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money
1	More classic Pac Of all of Tupac's post death material, this is probably my favourite album. Though some may complain that the songs were not as Pac intended, I think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part, the updated production is great. Most will already have heard the singles "letter 2 My Unborn" and "Until The End Of Time", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles. Other notable tracks are "This Aint Livin" which is probably the best track on here, "Breathin", "Everything They Owe", "Lastonesleft", "M.O.B" and "World Wide Mob Figgaz". In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good. It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs. Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame. I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much. While I have a load of respect for The Outlawz for staying true to Pac, I just don't rate their rapping skills too highly. Anyway an amazing album, especially considering Pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released. R.I.P Tupac
0	Hard to listen to. I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T
0	Very disappointed Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack. One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop. The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it! What's up with that?
1	Review of Live Show from Wayne's Tulsa Tour I saw a great show at Fishlips in Bakersfield last Wednesday: Wayne "The Train" Hancock. He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass. Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few. I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now. The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too.
1	A classic album! From the laid-back observations of Passenger to the anguished soul squeals of Turn Blue, Iggy injects a range of styles with honesty and irony. From beginning to end, a perfect listening experience! I don't think even one song is sub-par! If you like rock, you must own Lust For Life!
0	Atmosphere is Emo-Rap Let me start by saying that I thought that Atmosphere's early albums were much better(Most of Atmosphere's current fans have no idea that they had other albums...)But Seven's Travels is Slug and Ant's transformation into a crappy sell-out group, and the first ever emo-rap group. The people that love this album are always some teenager, usually some emo-kid, who decide they like rap and Atmosphere after hearing this album. They jump onto the official Atmosphere bandwagon, but dont think that they listen to rap...they listen to "rap". These emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better Atmosphere is, and how underground is the best. (Dont think from this that I am a fan of mainstream rap, i'm just explaining)The number one sign you can tell from, even by just looking at these reviews, is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks(Naturally, these teenage kids like to be different, and can't stop talking about it)or how this is real true rap music. So, basically, these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only Atmosphere album they've ever heard, Sevens Travels and live out their little emo lives listening to Atmosphere(for about 3 months). Even if these people listen to Atmosphere's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate Atmosphere super-fan!)it makes no difference because Atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now. The purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for emotionally-disturbed teenagers. Go buy some real hip-hop, and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to Sevens Travels
0	Ja is a poser Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer
1	Near-forgotten master of jazz guitar: buy this if you can... Mr. Farlow came along years before Wes Montgomery, and never achieved Wes's level of mass appeal. Listen to this 1956 album, however, and you will be amazed. This expanded CD has 63 swinging minutes of guitar, piano and bass, but the trio sounds like a quintet at least. The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good. As a non-musician, all I can say is &quot;This one is great fun and what 50's jazz was all about.&quot
0	I wanted the music on CD -- not the movie on CD I really enjoy the great synthesizer sound (usually this phrase would be an oxymoron) of this film. John Carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist (writer, director, composer). So, I am not in any way criticizing the music itself. My gripe is against this particular CD release. I was expecting to receive a CD with only the music. Unfortunately, very few of these tracks are music only. Most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie. If this only happened once or twice, I wouldn't mind so much. But it's nearly every single track. Would you buy the STAR WARS soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks? How about THE GODFATHER, LORD OF THE RINGS, GLADIATOR, or any other great motion picture soundtrack? If people want the dialogue, then they will surely buy the DVD. But most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only
0	Just for laughs, a little dissention... I bought this LP when it first came out. I'd drowned my happy soul in "Out of the Cool" and got lost for months in the moods of "Individualism". Add to that his "Guitar Forms" LP with Kenny Burrell and the "Sketches" album, I was ready for more of the pure Evanescence, and not ready for Gil Evans to do what most self-respecting composers do -- shift gears. No, change cars. In mid-drive. This album was a huge change to me, and I tried to follow him but couldn't. Kind of like trying to follow Stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase. Maybe he (Gil Evans) made it, maybe the other reviewers are right, and it's all great stuff, but it lost me. No magic, no startles, no surprises that I could suck into my soul and thrive on. So, be warned, be cautious. It's a change, and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career, and if you loved "Individualism", you might not make the jump. Then again, maybe you will. I just have to go on record to say all this, as one Evans fan who is disappointed
1	Joni's standards Although not a document of a working band, this is clearly a record Dave Douglas wanted to make. Following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers, he has drawn together the sympathetic talents of James Genus, Bill Carrothers and Billy Hart to pay tribute to Joni Mitchell. Hers is music he obviously loves, the reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire. The other music uses Joni Mitchell's ear for a great tune as a springboard for Dave's thoughtful, instantly appealing compositions. Beautifully recorded, this is a one-off; don't miss it
0	Last Rose of Summer-Deanna Durbin You have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on this item.I am sorry I cannot go over 2 stars as unfortunately there is a defect on last track of the record, precisely on the song "The last Rose of Summer".Anyhow I intend to buy other Deanna Durbin's records as I enjoy very much her voice, but unfortunately the wallet is empty now. Thanks for all your help on trying to find "Shane: a Tribute to Victor Young"but no euccess. I will try to buy another item later.
0	Have to agree with the majority - NOT a good CD Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it. I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it. I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it. We will not be listening again. As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews). The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.
1	Pop Rock Gem! It continues to amaze me to find "new" musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country. Everyone was amazed when Craig Chaquico pulled this off, Roger takes it to the next level. The closest event I can recall to this release is Steely Dan's 1972 "Can't Buy a Thrill" that put pop/rock on its ear. The influences are many and varied...Beach Boys, Beatles, Osmonds, Neil Sedaka, Jimmy Webb, The Who, Styx, Yes, Chicago, Alan Parsons, ELO/Jeff Lynn, Astrud Giberto, Wondermints, Burt Bacharach, Supertramp, 60's Brit Pop, the list goes on... As for Roger's vocal ability, he's no Bocelli, but he is better than 90% of the front men out there. He has a unique "honey" styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days (think Joseph Williams, David Pack, Donnie Osmond, Gerry Beckley). He doesn't try to imitate anyone, and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained. Primarily a keyboardist, his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well. Can't think of enough good things to say about this artist. Not every cut is excellent, but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive. The three deleted cuts from Solid State Warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40...during some point of time. Buy this CD Now
1	Every track takes you 'across the pond' You will not be disappointed by this delightful album! This may be sacrilege, but the Chieftains can get old after a while (well, they ARE old)...and Altan is certainly a breath of fresh air. These folks know what they're doing, and you can hear it in their whimsical reels. I look forward to getting more of their stuff. Highly recommended
0	Oregon's "Prime" is sadly mistitled I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, "Oh, THIS won't be jazz." Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found "Prime" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the "smooth jazz" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts
0	This is not the complete best of Fleetwood Mac! To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots. I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay.. Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!
1	dancing fantasy is blue knights ,red knights ,and colors in motion the group of dancing fantasy ,blue knights ,red knights are together .looking for the cd os straight from the heart to complete the whole collection of the group.
0	Release the movie score. The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for "Once Upon a Time in America" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released
0	Left Out Cal!!?!?!?!?!?!?! Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least. Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You -- Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few... To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment. Go Bears - Beat the Cougars
1	One of the classic Jazz CD/albums of all time I agree with the previous reviewer, cool jazz? John Lewis and Milt Jackson defined cool jazz. Much better than that crap now that I call "Smoove Jazz". This CD evokes memories of the Music Inn and Tanglewood in the 50s. The namesake of this CD is the song Django, a tribute to the late great Django Reinhardt. This is a must for any jazz enthusiasts collection
0	OUT TO LUNCH Since "Luck Of The Draw" Bonnie Raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch. "Fundamental" sounds like a jam session gone bad. There is really nothing special on this CD, except for "The Spit Of Love". When are we going to hear a song like "When The Spell Is Broken" again? Bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to Sue Foley and Kris Wiley. Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums
0	The new sony is very poor quality I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before. They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus. It would not even play in my CD player. When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the "WAV" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files. Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again
0	Fake! Fake! Fake! I bought one of these CD's many years ago and found out the hard way. What a joke and a ripoff. No original artists and nowhere on the CD does it say this. I never bought another one.
0	hhmmm go for bonnie tyler i say i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer. rest of music is very date
0	Gilding the Lilly The selection of songs for this cd is excellent, however unable to leave well enough along they include overblown intros, restarts, embellishments etc making the original tune almost unrecognizable. The arranger should be shot
1	WOW!!!!!!!! TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. "She lives by fake slide away". I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player
0	Wanted: For wack rhymes!!!!!!! I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a "hip hop teeny bopper". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should
1	Enjoy this tasty acoustic treat... It's HOT!! When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert, I like to listen to something quiet and soothing. THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing. During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape. As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous "Pizza boy" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community. Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album. This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing. Some people might dismiss it as "background music." However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found. Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to. Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation. I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings. By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box. Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings. On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!) I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album. The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!
1	No Worries Here! Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify four-stars. No worries here
1	AMAZING I love every kind of music and I recently was introduced to Tom Waits. My faviorte genre is metal but I cant stop listening to this guy. His voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful. Pasties And A G-String (At The Two O'Clock Club) and Step Right Up are my faviorte on this cd. I own a few other cds by Waits and I have yet to hear this guy make a bad song
0	WHAT A BUNCH OF MALARKY! WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
1	Ringo is a star Very nostalgic. When I was a kid, Photographs was the first song I ever heard true "stereo" on. Listening almost 25 years later, half the songs are pretty good, have are really kind of lousy, but the nostalgia is all great!
1	Letter from Satan "Dear Gordon: Remember the days when you showed such promise? Before you sold me your soul in exchange for super-stardom? You, Andy & Stewart really concocted a rockin' brew of punk, jazz, funk, pop sensibility and, oh yeah, 'reggatta'. Heh heh heh. Well, as our bargin dictates, you owe me another Mercedes commercial. Reminds me -- Phil Collins and the dude with the dreds from Counting Crows owe me another Disney soundtrack and Coke commercial, respectively. Ciao, my little corporate huckster! XOXO, Beelzebub. PS - How's the whole Tantric thing working out? Better make it 2 Mercedes commercials.
0	Bad beyond imagination The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion. The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like. These guys have zero talent and zero class
1	Beautiful!! This is a finely crafted album, it's just beautiful. Background harmonies from Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Trisha Yearwood.... Patty is fantastic on her own, but with these voices blended in, something special was created.
0	Mega Craptitude this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America!
1	This is what its all about This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!! This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
0	CHEATER DECEIVER If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately
0	Bummer---Barely Average Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves. As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation. There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best.
1	Amazing Thsi album is amazing, they use simple household noises and make it into music, these people are geniuses! This album sounds great, it's very insturmental. It's like a clash of noises and happy,cuddly things, and dreamy stuff! It really gets you thinking.
0	Solid As A Rock? Not Really 2 and a half stars. This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album "I Give You My Word". Highlights of "The Rock"- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas
0	Fnak - this is bad. I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned: 1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the "my life sucks" and "everyone hates me" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done Anyone want to buy a used CD
1	Wow... This album is fantastic. I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great. This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons: 1. They have a second drummer on this thing, and 2. There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album. My thoughts on both: The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him. Its astounding. If you play the drums, you need to hear this album. The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too. It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer. All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast. The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound. They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs. And they're awesome! The Melvins sound great playing fast! The intro to "The Hawk" just TEARS!!! I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic. It rocks so hard. I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better. I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album. Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start. I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band. Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out. You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be. Take their self titled album (or "Lysol" to the diehards), for example. Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you. But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads. So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like "A Senile Animal" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around. So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album. And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album. If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it. Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini. Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol. As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this? Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance. How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right? Its inhuman
1	Burn, burn, yes you gonna BURN! From all the other reviews, you can pry tell what they sound like so I will just rate the songsw with my opinion Bombtrack--5/5---Hard rockin with some damn good rappin mixed in Killing in the Name--5/5---When you listen closely, you can hear the message, put in an amazing rock hit. Take the power back--5/5---Funky, enjoyable, rockin, what more do you need. Some great riffs in this Wake Up--4/5---Don't listen to this song very often because you wont want to hear it too much. Settle for nothing--1/5---terrible, slow with too much goddamn screaming. The one song by this band that I hate Know you enemy--5/5---funky rock.rap song that is a lot of fun to listen to Bullet in your head--4/5---Great bass lines, but a little annoying with too much screaming Wake up--4/5 Fistful of steel--5/5 Township rebellion--3/5--- a little annoying, but fun for a little while Freedom--5/5---Great album close
0	Noise, yes. Ambient or art, no. Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there
0	Disappointed in quality As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected
1	Excellent! This cd rocks! I bought it years ago and still listen to it all the time. I love the indigo girls
1	Deeply devout music from our greatest Christian composer This disc contains three works by Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina, an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles: "In croce", "Silenzio", and "Sieben Worte". The common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan. The latter is a type of Russian accordian played here by Elsbeth Moser, who performed in the Western premier of "Sieben Worte" and to whom Gubaidulina dedicated "Silenzio." Cello is played by Maria Kliegel, who has performed under the approval of Rostropovich. "In Croce" was originally written in 1979 as a piece for organ and cello, but it is represented here in a 1991 arrangement for cello and bayan by Elsbeth Moser which Gubaidulina has approved. It is an exploration of "vertical" music (the organ or bayan) intersected by the "horizontal" (cello), thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in Gubaidulina's work. Personally, I prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by Ivashkin and Hicks released by Chandos, for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan. Still, Kliegel's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing, less restrained than Ivashkin's but perhaps more passionately religious. "Silenzio" is a fragile, insubstantial piece for bayan, violin, and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo. It consists of five "miniatures" which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways. It is an interesting experiment, but it results in the least interesting item on this disc, and it's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power. "Sieben Worte (Seven Words)" for cello, bayan, and strings, is a crucial piece in this disc, and in Gubaidulina's oeuvre in general. I have said before that the composer's "Johannes-Passion" may be the greatest work of Christian piety of our time, but "Sieben Worte" follows not very long behind. It is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition, and contains quotations from Heinrich Schuetz and clear influence from Haydn. Nonetheless, the bulk of the piece shows the originality of Gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here, but which is included in the liner notes. The strings of the Camerata Transsylvanica (ironically based in Budapest after the emigration of its members) under Gyorgy Selmeczi are intense and unfaltering. As is unfortunately usual with Naxos discs, the weak point is the liner notes. The English and German are, inexplicably, two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other. Keith Anderson's English commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional. Teresa Pieschacon Raphael's German commentary tells something about Gubaidulina's place in the Soviet music community which English readers too should have been able to enjoy. Though Naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages, the profile of the performers is only in English. These three pieces, especially the last, make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer, and at an economic price. This is one of the finest works in my collection, and I sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone
1	Great Melodies ! Truly the best of Ennio Morricone's music: very exciting, diverse and colorful, this CD is a great value. If you like Morricone's music, you'll probably love Arye Geiman - a yet unknown, but young and promising composer, whose music is also very melodic. [...
0	&quot;Everything is Possible&quot; but don't buy everything What drugs do I need to take to make this sound good? So many raved about this group so I bought a cd. Big mistake, HUGE. I'm such a sucker
1	A must for bluegrass lovers. A must for lovers of bluegrass guitar and banjo pickin' by three of America's greatest musicians. Some classic stuff and, thankfully, some pieces I'd never heard. Very high quality recording. Unfortunately, there's only 11 cuts and I could listen for hours
0	Basura Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada..........
0	cheese fest bwahaaaaaahaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahha NO SERIOUSLY im not finished HOLDING MY SIDES YET BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh man to actually think their are kids out there who consider this music. I know im going to quit my job and paint my face with clown make up and change my name to weakho The @$$ clown (hey it wouldnt be any more ridiculous than any of these other lame retards names. colton grundy???) and I should have millions by the end of the year from all the fuggaloes who are obviously smokin punds of weed out of a pipe to be diggin this junk. Canibus or asheru could rip these weak retards inside of one verse minus 500,000,000,000,000 stars. peace to all the real Hip hoppers out ther
1	Wonderful Undeniable Groove I do not have many Kenny Loggins CD's. I bought the &quot;Essentials&quot; CD's and then found out about this one. I am really enjoying this CD. The songs &quot;fit&quot; into my playlists whether I am playing only Kenny Loggins music or playing other Artists as well. It is always good when I can mesh the music with my mood. So far I have been able to pull out this CD and find something that matched. I would have liked a few more songs
1	Timeless and remarkable When I first heard Hatfield and The North back in -73, the music made a distinct impression on me. I love the sound of this band, with the easily recognizeable sound of the Northettes, arrangements Rhodes el-piano, solos with the Lowery organ (***** to Dave Stewart), the sleepy voice of Richard Sinclair and overall atmosphere. Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites...
1	Reeves at his best If you are tired of the usual guitar playing, with all its already extremely used ways, but don't want to give up listening rock'n'roll, you really should get this album. Not only a guitar player, but also a songwriter growing after each work, he can give you rock at the best level, and at the same time showing something new, that will not sound strange to your years. That's a difficult task you have to admit. And if you think that this is all, you should get his last online album &quot; Ulysses (della notte)&quot; even better than this
0	Unfulfilled promise The mixing on some tracks is awful, and at one point, vocals are lost altogether on The Rascals track. I love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling (I commute 50 miles round trip every day) is great, but the quality could be lots better
0	Prince on Only one song Were is my boy Prince man this really ticked me off he is only on one song first disc just another sucker then you dont hear him anymore maybe they were alking about us if your a prince fan dont buy this unless you collect his songs like i do cause just another sucker is all you get for a person that collects i dont have that one
1	Ack! I Like Children's Music! I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.) It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too
0	Why No new songs? I give this CD one star, not because it isn't good, but, because it is the same stuff they have already sold once. I am a big Blind Melon fan. I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums. The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves
1	Harry can do no wrong I've followed Harry for years and have always enjoyed his albums because each one has a slightly different sound from the rest. This latest CD is light, has gentle compositions, and is also swingin' fun. It puts me in the mood for dancing under the stars or curling up by the fire. I think it's about time Harry did a CD like this
1	Uh. haha. Well, this album is pretty terrible, but I like it anyway. If you're looking for an album to get you into Modest Mouse, then this definitely isn't it. Anyone else who would want it probably already has it.
1	Heartbreakingly Beautiful Michael Hoppe is a treasure. From his earliest recordings until his latest, Requiem, I have never been disappointed. Solace does not have one track that you will skip over. The soloists, where there are vocals, are superb and speak straight to the heart. Occasionally we are given a musical gift that lasts us a lifetime. This is one of those gifts.

1	As Good As It Comes This very fine cd - from County Records of Virginia - is superb! County have once again produced a well balanced selection from the archives and have presented it to the public for their delectation. I would recommend this item to all lovers of traditional American Country Music. Don't let it pass you by
1	Personal Favorite Jimi Hendrix is arguably the all time Master of the Guitar. He has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing. While I enjoy the sort of Hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio, many songs just aren't heard unless one owns the album. South Saturn Delta is one of my personal favorites. If you enjoy First Rays of the New Rising Sun, or Axis: Bold as Love, any Hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more. Play on Jimi
1	Wow! Oreja de Van Gogh really's beyond comparison. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys imports as much as I do. Its really a mix of pop, rock, ska, raggae, electronica, and ballads. I got this CD thinking it would have the song &quot;Cuidate&quot; in it, without even checking on the back, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized it was the wrong CD. &quot;Cuentame al Oido&quot; is simply mesmorizing, and &quot;Viejo Cuento&quot; and &quot;Dile Al Sol&quot; are really cool too. Listen to the entire CD..it's good for a variety of moods. Enjoy
1	The Best singer you've never heard of..... I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's. At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days); then I distinctly heard Hank; on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days). All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams. But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride. If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so. As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet. Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off. While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts: "I Gotta Get Drunk", "The Last Song I'll Ever Sing", and "Shoot The Buffalo" all showcase his voice. And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding "Fraulein" and "Who'll buy the Wine". This is one of those albums you have to own; and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++
0	Rating box would not accept 0... Please change your name to (KID RAP).. When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name... Stop playing both sides.. I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about.. Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..
1	absolutely surerb! I love every track of this CD. Specially, 'Missing you now', 'Now that I found you' and 'We're not making love anymore'. He sounds so perfect for me and I completely leave everything when anybody plays his song. Great lyrics, perfect pitch and absolutely worthy CD to buy. ITS SUPERB and deserves more than 5 stars
0	Gut bustin humor for people who miss "hee haw"! NOT! This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin
1	all the drama that you crave Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other. It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility. When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, "out of my body, out of my skin," you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production. The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of "One More Hour," the fury of "Words and Guitar," the sexiness of "Dance Song '97." This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart
0	Yikes!! Singing is way out of tune! The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon". Don't take my word for it. Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com . At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes! Even someone with no musical training can hear it. The rest of the pieces sound fine
1	From Start to Finish. . . a Killer Album! Bob is the King! The KING! Get this disc, you will dig it. You can really sense the urgency in this CD. Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album. If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand. From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll
0	poppers folly This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them
0	This is not good, don't believe the hype! Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this
0	Whats this song called Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it
0	Waylon Jennings Sings Hank Williams This was a great disappointment. Waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made! I love Waylon Jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing. I'm sure if the recording had of been better quality I would have loved this
0	Oh Em Gee, What happened Gwen? A giant leap back from Love.Angel.Music.Baby. What was she thinking with this album? This music does not compare at all to L.A.M.B. and her No Doubt days. 'The Sweet Escape' (song) is very successful on the charts, ...and I honestly don't understand why. It's so generic and 'woo hoo' part is so annoying. The album is a one star but I'll give her two because I still love Gwen
0	BAD CD MONO SOUND JUST A REAL BAD CD
0	Bob's worst I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released. In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst. Just a really bad CD. 'Nuff said
0	REGRETS This CD I regret to say is not up to Reba's standard of performance. She's done much better.
0	Inconsistent. Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated. "Whip-Smart" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to "Exile in Guyville", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought. Probably the most important thing about "Whip-Smart" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from ("X-Ray Man", "Crater Lake"), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of "Chopsticks" to the haunting, moody, "Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging "Jealousy". Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding. Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup. Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete ("Alice Springs"), fall apart ("Support System", "Go West") or are plain irritating ("Cinco de Mayo", "May Queen"). Its got its moments, but "Whip-Smart" is largely disposable-- start with Phair's debut, "Exile in Guyville", its everything its regarded as
0	Ummmm....sorry, this one isn't very good. Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute. Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all. Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets. I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time
0	They were labelled "creative" as children I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art. People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages. They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks. Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears. To call this good music is an insult to good musicians. I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album. Creative; maybe. Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no
0	The reason why shred is dead When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album. Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff. Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding. The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.
