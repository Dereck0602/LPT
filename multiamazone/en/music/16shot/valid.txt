1	Exquisite I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks
1	Start here if you're new to Branford This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since. I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it. Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer. In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music. If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it. If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start. You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style. I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone). Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound. I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years. If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so
0	Who Is This? There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child. Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't
1	Elvin Jones Kicks Ass O.K. folks here we go, from an ex- Santa Barbara disc jockey to you. The best song on this excellent CD is Las Vegas Tango. What should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of Elvin Jones on drum. The band itself is tight and strong. The song is kinda haunting. I've hummed it to myself for the past forty years, and after losing the album a while back, I bought a new CD of it through Amazon.com from England, and I am very happy I own it. I think everyone should own at least one of this, one for themselves and one to give to a friend. This album, and particularly Las Vegas Tango, is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century. Buy it
0	Music BAM! The nightfox laser dance song without question is a sample/remix/remake/ BAM from a part of the score from the 1979 Italian movie, The Concorde Affair. Just saw it on 3-8-07 and saw Ocean 12 like 2 weeks prior. No doubt it is the same thing only redone. Randy
1	John Mayer: New to me. Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later. John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me.
1	Rifkin going from strength to strenghth i have to admit Rifkin's version of the B Minor Mass, although shocked me a bit at first, managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory. the point is that in Bach's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments. so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists. with this in mind, Rifkin's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship. the sounds are crisp, the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect. I got this CD after being convinced by the Mass in B Minor. Highly recommended
1	"Won't You Try?" Jefferson Airplane tried hard, on this 1967 utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic SURREALISTIC PILLOW. Having made RCA millions of dollars with PILLOW, the Airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the Sixties. Listening to AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is literally a trip. Bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques, sound montages, and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination. Everything goes, and so it went at BAXTER'S. It was all new, avant-garde to excess, and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential. Most art does fail, but there's no question that BAXTER'S cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles. The influence of BAXTER'S can be heard in "Revolution 9" by The Beatles, and on many other recordings of the era. BAXTER'S may have sold poorly, but it was heard by the Airplane's contemporaries, and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration. An aficionado's album, AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today.
1	A pleasure to listen to... Belinda Carlisle is such a smooth and pleasant singer. It is so nice to listen to hear. This is a nice set of great hits
0	NIN Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap
0	Very Disappointed ...Thoughts from a Cohen "First Timer" I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters. Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about. Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed. I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable. Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best. Specific example that speaks volumes: listen to Cohen's singing of his "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994. Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song. It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy. "Tant pis, vers le bonheur.
1	Excellent Great 80's sounding pop, but with a lot of 2006 uniqueness. I love it
0	If you want GnR's Greatest Hits or Best of then just pick up Appetite For Destruction AFD was one of the greatest rock albums ever made. I wanted to hate the album so much. I was an alternative/avant guard snob when AFD was released. To me, these clowns were just another hairspray band. But I took a long car trip with some chick I was banging and her roommate. The roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip. By the end, I was hooked. That's the mark of truly great art. If it can draw in someone who's predisposed to hate it, its got something special. I looked forward to the next album, G N' R Lies. But when it came out, I was disappointed. It was ok, but hardly the cultural epoch that was AFD. Nice Boys was kind of fun. Used to Love Her was a humorous novelty song. Mama Kin was a decent cover, but no real improvement over the original. The rest of the disk was just crap. But what the hell, its was just an EP right? Something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece. Then came GnR's death knell, the two Use Your Illusions. Over-produced, bloated, boring and pretentious. Everything I had always hated Hair-Metal for in the first place. Gone was the sound of the alley ways of Sunset Boulevard, replaced by the sound of computers, maids and Beverley Hills hookers n blow parties. Rock n Roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist. Nothing to see here. Move along. So, if you want to see the genius and promise of GnR, just pick up Appetite For Destruction, and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time
0	THE DVD IS BAD, AS IN NOT WORTH WATCHING !!!!! I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S.....................
1	Lotsa goodies in this stocking Well, somehow I picked up the Rev's first-ever Christmas album even before the two Brians' 2005 holiday discs (the sainted Wilson and the slick Setzer, that is). As Santa said of Rudolph's first jump at the Reindeer Games in that classic Rankin-Bass "Rudolph" special, not bad! Not baaaad! There are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this Christmas stocking, enough to please most of the Whos at your local Whoville. The disc has a chunk of Chuck Berry, and not just the album-closing "Run Rudolph Run" (with the Rev, aka guitarist Jim Heath, trading instruments with his bassist, Jimbo Wallace). It actually starts with track 1, the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of "Frosty the Snowman." The credits don't list the pianist, but "Winter Wonderland" also has a lot of that Berry/Johnnie Johnson interplay, straight out of "You Never Can Tell." There's also a bit of blazing Berry/Johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places: alongside a mad-mod-surf "Batman" swirl on "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town." Other yummy flavors in the Rev's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of "Jingle Bells," a Ray Charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of "Silver Bells," a snarky, dirty, bottom-heavy, finger-popping rockabilly swing through "Rudolph," a hoedown of "Santa on the Roof," and an instrumental of "What Child Is This" that tosses around country, surf, spaghetti western, even a little bit of Traffic and Hendrix. That's to go along with faithful versions of Elvis' "Santa Bring My Baby Back" and Buck Owens' "Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy." The only soft spot is Heath's voice. The Rev's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups, but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of "Silver Bells" and "Pretty Paper," or even "Santa Bring My Baby Back." But hey -- you know what? This album is such a high-spirited affair, and the Rev, Jimbo and Scott Churilla, the drummer, have been such good boys this year, that Santa can overlook that shortcoming. They should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer
1	holy whack! this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell.
1	Music to get your blood flowing! Wow! Great quartets played with real gusto and dynamism by the Prager String Quartet. The sound is incredibly crisp and clear. The performances are impeccable. You won't be disappointed
1	dreamy surf island music I love this album! It takes me back to the islands, basking in the sun, sipping a mai tai, w/ some local cats playing under the palapa. I'm a big fan of the Aqua Velvets, and Miles playing is stunninly gorgeous on this cd as well
0	Customer Service The Item you sent me was not the right item. I think? Then you sent me the same item back to me.? Did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on REISSUE and REMASTER. I could have already purchased this item, REISSUE, at the store down the street for less the amount that I spent at Amazon. Sorry not a satisfied customer
1	Sloppy Mush This review concentrates on the four live tracks. By December 1970, Miles Davis' fusion was evolving even beyond the Bitches Brew era. The emphasis was more and more in the rhythm, and less and less on coherent solos. Miles Davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn, getting a sound that was thin, whiny and rather annoying. Keith Jarrett and Michael Henderson joined the band, lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively. Live Evil basically consists of several edited jams from the Cellar Door recordings of December 1970. SIVAD: The recording begins on a high point; vicious funk punctuated by Airto Moreira's squawking Cuica, and stabbed through with Miles Davis' electric trumpet. This is actually a version of "Directions" by Joe Zawinul, although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable. The statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade. Miles' horn is electric, and its sound is a mixture of Birth of the Cool and Axis: Bold as Love. Truly strange, and frankly not a very nice sound. Three and a half minutes in, the groove shifts to "Honky Tonk", a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme. The performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune (!) and one studio version! Miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section; and Airto Moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny. Sloppy and shapeless. WHAT I SAY: A feature for Jack de Johnette, a terrific drummer. The groove is extremely harsh and energetic, with Miles soloing with an open horn. Unlike the other tracks, this is actually a complete performance (segueing into "Sanctuary" at the end) and is quite impressive. I really like Jarret's electric piano/organ solo and Johnette's drum solo! FUNKY TONK/INAMORATA: In which Teo Macero goes nuts with the scissors. This is actually one big slab of a performance, cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an LP. And it is not one piece of music, but three: 1. "Directions": Yet another performance of Zawinul's piece. Much more conventional than the "Sivad" version, though again with all the statements of the theme cut out. Miles soloes with electric trumpet. 2. Then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the Mission Impossible theme! So this is where they got that theme. The name of the tune is sometimes called "Funky Tonk", and sometimes "Inamorata". A very long, sloppy, shapeless morass of solos. Again, Jarret's solo is most beautiful. 3.Finally the groove shifts to "It's About That Time" from "In a Silent Way". A performance that does not shift into the second bassline. Halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird, associative poem about the mysteries of Music. At the fade-out, you can hear the groove shifting to "Sanctuary..." Overall, the album is extremely messy, with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing. Atmospheric and very dense.
1	Working This Weekend To Buy This Now I know everybody would love this CD. It is definately for the young AND old. The tracks sound great and the new liner notes are amazing. A great mix of Loverboy's best hits, including Working For the Weekend!!
1	A good value, and a great place to start I was only casually aquainted with Mary Chapin Carpenter's music before picking up this album. The hits I knew were all here, and so was a lot more material I have come to love as well. I was a bit leery that &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; was a live version from the Super Bowl; this song was the primary reason I wanted a MCC album, and I was concerned a live version recorded in a stadium during the Super Bowl might be of inferior recording quality. But I needn't have worried, the sound is great, and the performance is energetic and fun, with a verse in Creole thrown in for good measure. &quot;This Shirt&quot; is probably my favorite track I was unfamiliar with, but the entire album is quality; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where I can say I enjoyed every song. I now look forward to exploring her original albums. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an introduction to this great artist
0	Don't Buy This Cd! This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks
0	Not as good as it shoulda, coulda been... I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a &quot;real song&quot;, so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs &quot;make it&quot; just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either
1	Wonderfully balanced between Spring and Winter This is an excellent CD with the wonderful music of Rampal's flute and Laskine's harp, a perfect and unique match. Whereas the CD contains many beautiful works, there are three that are sublime and deserve mention. "Nambu Ushioi Uta" a Japanese folksong is a unique work as the sad willow melody is pierced by sharp flute interruptions, like an obstinate sparrow continually breaking the silence of melancholy. The piece tip-toes like an elegant silk veil floating on a branch over a night garden. With its broken pacing, the melodies remain sad and reflective, but always interrupted by the pesty bird chirp, like a crocus on a dark mid-winter morning. "Defune", a mature echoing ghosty melody builds a sad journey of experience and time. I would listen to this song over and over, allowing it to release any grief that I harbored. There is a lilting passage that builds and allows the harp to mirror or reflect the building lilting passage established by the flute. Then the piece moves toward a resolution of quite contemplation. The CD ends with "Sakura Sakura" which Rampal and Laskine play for all it is worth, starting with a minimal slow paced introduction of the melody which is no sooner established than is rendered with a pastoral interpretation of the classic tune. And as the flute wavers like a songbird, a triump of music begins to build and anchors the central presentation of the work. Now having established and adorned this rich tapestry, Rampal and Laskine begin pulling every golden and silver thread from this whole cloth to integrate minimal repetitions of the central melody finally offered to us in atonal windstorms and durges, retaining its uncanny beauty, made even more beautiful by the lack of perfection, the final sour note. This CD is superb in that it balances the 3 tragic pieces I describe above with 8 other works of more gaity and light. I predict that this will be one of your favorite CDs for years to come
0	Funniest thing I have ever encountered music-wise This band is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Go to their website, www.mightyrhapsody.com here you will find why they are so damn funny. These guys actually believe they are dragon slayers! I can't stop laughing at this band! Say hello to Medieval Metal
0	Rubbish Yo, don't take this the wrong way because I'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan. But this album is terrible. Its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old Biggie verses and whipping up new beats. Biggie certainly didn't leave very much unreleased material unlike Tupac then again I suppose he wasn't expecting he was going to die. But they still shouldn't do s*** like this. If you want to support Biggie's legacy this year which isn't a bad idea, pick up one of the classics - Ready 2 Die or Life After Death.
0	Left Out Cal!!?!?!?!?!?!?! Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least. Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You -- Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few... To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment. Go Bears - Beat the Cougars
0	Garbage! Pure Garbage! Garbage! Pure garbage! Sh**! Pure sh**! The only reason she got any type of record deal is because of her looks. She cannot sing whatsoever, and her voice is terrible, and she has no place in the music industry. If you have not noticed, all her hits (only 3 of them) are all collaborations, which says a lot because she can't even sell on her own and stand on her own feet. The only good song on here is "It's all about me" with Sisqo. Seriously, don't waste your time or your money on this talentless slut! Grade:
0	poorly produced This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music
0	DOnt' even bother The remix sucks. DOn't even buy the whole remixes on iTunes, they really are bad. I will write reviews for their other remixes. Nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment. The title is the NATO Phoetic alphabet, your stupid piece of _____. Once again, you have no idea what you are talking about. Becuase your stupid. Tell me, could you write a song like this? Your respone will be: No, but It's stupid anyway! or, YES! No, no you couldn't. _____ off, your reasons on your pathetic reivew for Hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are. THe people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the BHG haters are
